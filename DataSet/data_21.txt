From "Watson v. United States" ==> """
Watson v. United States, 552 U.S. 74 (2007), is a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court had earlier held in Smith v. United States (1993) that the exchange of a gun for drugs constituted "use" of a firearm for purposes of a federal statute imposing penalties for "use" of a firearm "during and in relation to" a drug trafficking crime; in Watson, the court decided that a transaction in the opposite direction does not violate the same statute (i.e., Smith holds that one "uses" a gun by giving it in exchange for drugs, and Watson holds that one does not "use" a gun by receiving it in exchange for drugs).
Question presented
Whether a person who trades his drugs for a gun "uses" a firearm "during and in relation to... (a) drug trafficking crime" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)(A)?
Ruling
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court saying that Smith held that firearms may be “used” in barter transaction, even with no violent employment and that it addressed the trader only, who swaps his gun for drugs, not the trading partner who ends up with the gun. Bailey v. United States (1995), too, does not help because it ruled that a gun must be made use of actively to satisfy 924(c)(1)(A), as “an operative factor in relation to the predicate offense.” The majority of the Court held that a person does not “use” a firearm under 924(c)(1)(A) when he receives it in trade for drugs, the Judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
Decision and Rationale
The Fifth Circuit affirmed that receiving a firearm constituted “use” for the purposes. The decision at which the Supreme Court arrived at via unanimous decision was that the momentary possession of the received unloaded semi-automatic pistol was not sufficient to constitute the “use” of the weapon. The rationale behind the Watson situation is that even though there was a firearm present in the transaction, Watson was not carrying it during the transaction. The weapon was unloaded and in his possession for a minimal amount of time. The decision withheld therefore was that Watson's bartering of drugs for the pistol did not constitute the “use” of the weapon due to the fact that the weapon was not loaded, he was not carrying it during the transaction and only had ownership of the firearm for few minutes before being arrested by officials.
Concurrence
Justice Ginsburg delivered the concurrence to the court. She states that she agrees with the opinion of the court but has a different reasoning. Her reasoning is that she defines the word “use” to mean using as a weapon and not in bartering transactions. She also goes on to state that she would overrule Smith, 508 U.S., at 241, and make the precedent both “coherent and consistent with normal usage.”

From "Watts v. Indiana" ==> """
Watts v. Indiana, 338 U.S. 49 (1949), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court ruled that the use of a confession obtained through rigorous interrogation methods by Law Enforcement violates the Fourteenth Amendment..
In his concurrence/dissent, Justice Robert Jackson famously opined, "To bring in a lawyer means a real peril to solution of the crime because, under our adversary system, he deems that his sole duty is to protect his client—guilty or innocent—and that, in such a capacity, he owes no duty whatever to help society solve its crime problem. Under this conception of criminal procedure, any lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect in no uncertain terms to make no statement to police under any circumstances."
In this case, a defendant was subjected to rigorous interrogation methods, including being forced to sleep on the floor, resulting in a confession to having committed murder. The Supreme Court ruled that the confession was involuntary and reversed his conviction.
Thurgood Marshall represented the defendant, Robert A. Watts, in Watts v. Indiana.

From "Webster v. Doe" ==> """
Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592 (1988), is a case decided by the United States Supreme Court that presented statutory and constitutional claims by a former CIA employee who alleged that his termination was the result of discrimination based on sexual orientation.. 
Background
The National Security Act of 1947 authorizes the Director of the CIA "in his discretion" to terminate the employment of any employee whenever he shall deem it to be in the security interests of the United States. John Doe, a CIA employee, voluntarily admitted to a CIA security guard that he was a homosexual. Despite having previously received ratings of "excellent" and "outstanding" employee performance, the employee was placed on administrative leave and later terminated as the result of his admission. William J. Casey, the Director of the CIA at that time, cited Doe's homosexuality as a threat to security. (Note that even though William H. Webster is named as the petitioner, Casey was the Director at the time of Doe's termination.)
Opinion of the Court
The issue presented before the Supreme Court was whether, and to what extent, the termination decisions of the Director under 102(c) are judicially reviewable. The Court, in an opinion delivered by Chief Justice Rehnquist, held that Section 102(c) of the National Security Act, 50 U.S.C. 403(c), precluded review under the Administrative Procedure Act. However, the Court held that the Act did not preclude review of constitutional claims (as opposed to the procedural claims). The Court reasoned that Congress should not be taken to have intended to preclude constitutional claims unless it has explicitly so provided (603). 
Dissent
Justice Scalia was the only justice to completely dissent; Justice O'Connor concurred in part and dissented in part while Justice Kennedy took no part in the consideration or decision of the case. Justice Scalia wrote in his dissent, "Neither the Constitution, nor our laws, nor common sense gives an individual a right to come into court to litigate the reasons for his dismissal as an intelligence agent" (620).

From "Webster v. Reproductive Health Services" ==> """
Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490 (1989), was a United States Supreme Court decision on upholding a Missouri law that imposed restrictions on the use of state funds, facilities, and employees in performing, assisting with, or counseling an abortion..  The Supreme Court in Webster allowed for states to legislate in an aspect that had previously been thought to be forbidden under Roe v. Wade (1973)..
Background
The state of Missouri passed a law which in its preamble stated that "the life of each human being begins at conception", and "unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and well-being."
The statute
 required that all Missouri state laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with rights equal to those enjoyed by other persons, subject to limits imposed by the federal constitution, and federal court rulings;
 prohibited government-employed doctors from aborting a fetus they believed to be viable;
 prohibited the use of state employees or facilities to perform or assist abortions, except where the mother's life was in danger; and
 prohibited the use of public funds, employees, or facilities to "encourage or counsel" a woman to have an abortion, except where her life was in danger.
The United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri struck down the above provisions, and prohibited their enforcement. This decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which ruled that these provisions violated Roe v. Wade  and later Supreme Court decisions. William L. Webster, then Missouri Attorney General, appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. It was argued before the Court on April 26, 1989.
Opinion of the Court
left|thumb|Pro-choice and anti-abortion advocates demonstrating outside the Supreme Court during Webster arguments
The Court overturned the decision of the lower courts, stating that:
 The Court did not need to consider the constitutionality of the law's preamble, as it is not used to justify any abortion regulation otherwise invalid under Roe v. Wade.
 The prohibitions on the use of public employees, facilities, and funds did not violate any of the Court's abortion decisions, as no affirmative right to the use of state aid for nontherapeutic abortions existed. The state could allocate resources in favor of childbirth over abortion if it so chose.
 Provisions requiring testing for viability after 20 weeks of pregnancy were constitutional, but those limiting abortions in the second trimester of pregnancy were unconstitutional.
Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion of the Court for all but Parts II-D and III; however, only Justices White and Kennedy joined that opinion in its entirety. In discussing the fetal viability section, the plurality asserted that the right to abortion was a "liberty interest protected by the Due Process clause" subject to restriction by any laws which would permissibly further a rational state interest such as protecting potential life. The plurality said that this would require the court to "modify and narrow Roe and succeeding cases."
Justices O'Connor and Scalia joined Rehnquist's opinion except for the section on viability testing. Each wrote a separate concurring opinion. Justice O'Connor claimed that narrowing Roe v. Wade in the context of the Webster litigation, where upholding Missouri's law could arguably be squared with Roe, would violate an important principle of judicial restraint. She then explained that she voted to uphold Missouri's law because she did not feel that it would place an undue burden on the right to abortion.
Justice Scalia, who was angered by the refusal of the plurality, as well as Justice O'Connor, to overturn Roe v. Wade, wrote a sharp opinion concurring in the judgment. In his concurrence he argued that the Court ought to have overturned Roe, rather than attempting to uphold both Roe and the laws at issue, and he attacked Justice O'Connor's justification for declining to overturn Roe. He also agreed with Blackmun's assertion that the approach of the plurality would make Roe a dead letter.
Dissent
Justice Blackmun wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, which focused on the plurality's desired narrowing of Roe as described in the section on the viability testing requirement. He wrote that the plurality's approach would allow a state to put virtually any restriction on abortion so long as it was rationally related to promoting potential life, and that this in effect would overturn Roe. Noting that the plurality and Scalia together were only a single vote away from effectively overruling Roe, he wrote "I fear for the future" and "a chill wind blows."
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a separate dissent, where he concurred with the plurality in allowing the state to prohibit public funds from being allocated for abortion counselling, but argued the court otherwise should have upheld the lower courts in striking down the remaining restrictions.

From "Weeks v. United States" ==> """
Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383 (1914) was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court unanimously held that the warrantless seizure of items from a private residence constitutes a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.The Fourth Amendment states: "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." It also  prevented local officers from securing evidence by means prohibited under the federal exclusionary rule and giving it to their federal colleagues. It was not until the case of Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), that the exclusionary rule was deemed to apply to state courts as well.
Background
On December 21, 1911, Fremont Weeks, the plaintiff in error and defendant, was arrested by a police officer at the Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri, where an express company employed him. Weeks was convicted of using the mails for the purpose of transporting lottery tickets, in violation of the Criminal Code. At the time of his arrest, police officers went to Weeks' house to search it. A neighbor told them where to find the key. Officers entered the house of the defendant without a search warrant and took possession of papers and articles, which were turned over to the US marshals. The officers returned later on the same day with the marshal, still without a warrant, and seized letters and envelopes that they found in the drawer of a chiffonier.
His papers were used to convict Weeks of transporting lottery tickets through the mail, Weeks petitioned against the police for the return of his private possessions.
 Decision 
The Supreme Court unanimously decided that since there was no warrant, the search was illegal. Therefore, the papers found should have been excluded because of the Fourth Amendment.

From "Weems v. United States" ==> """
Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349 (1910), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court. It is primarily notable as it pertains to the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. It is cited concerning the political and legal relationship between the United States and the Philippines, which at that time was considered a U.S. colony (see Philippine–American War for more information).
Background
Paul A. Weems, plaintiff in error, was a disbursing officer of the Bureau of Coast Guard and Transportation. He was charged, in the Philippine courts, with falsifying a public and official document for the purposes of defrauding the government. He was convicted of this and sentenced to 15 years incarceration, and a fine of 4,000 Philippine pesos. The conviction and sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands. Weems filed a demurrer to the charges, but this was overruled as well.
Weems filed a writ of error with the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming that the charges against him were improper, and his conviction should, therefore, be overruled.
Arguments
The argument brought by the plaintiff contained four points, one of which was abandoned due to a mistake of fact. The abandoned point was that the record did not state that Weems was arraigned, that he issued a plea to the complaint upon his demurrer being overruled, and that he was "ordered to plead to the complaint."
The three points that the plaintiff actually argued are as follows:
 First, the Philippine court was in error when it overruled Weems' demurrer. This point is based on the plaintiff being described as a "disbursing officer of the Bureau of Coast Guard and Transportation of the Philippine Islands," a body politic which does not exist.
 Second, the record did not demonstrate that Weems was present when he was tried, or that he was actually in court at any time.
 Third, the Philippine court's sentence of 15 years in prison constituted cruel and unusual punishment, necessitating a reversal of the judgment.
Decision
Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court, joined by Chief Justice Fuller and Justices Harlan and Day. Justice Lurton, who had not been a member of the Court when the case had been argued, did not take part in the decision. Justice Moody was absent on account of sickness and Justice Brewer died before the opinion was delivered.
The Court determined that the plaintiff's first assignment of error was incorrect. The opinion cited acts of U.S. Congress and the Philippine Commission as indicating that their respective governments, while politically connected in important ways, were separate and distinct entities. The Court specifically cites the Philippine Criminal Code of Procedure, which, in part, requires that charges be, "in such form as to enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended," and that no trial, judgment, or other proceeding can, "be affected, by reason of a defect in matter of form which does not tend to prejudice a substantial right of the defendant upon the merits."
Addressing the second and third points of the plaintiff's argument simultaneously, the Court determined that the sentence of 15 years in prison was unconstitutionally cruel and unusual. In particular, the Court noted that the conditions of incarceration specifically included being chained from wrist to ankle and compelled to work at "hard and painful labor." Citing a line of cases related to 8th Amendment concerns, the Court demonstrated also that such a severe penalty for so relatively minor a crime was impermissible. In fact, the Court stated that even if the least severe form of punishment statutorily allowed for this crime had been ordered, this would have been "repugnant to the Bill of Rights." Stating that the fault was in the law itself, and seeing no other applicable law under which Weems could be sentenced, the Court ordered the judgment reversed, with directions to dismiss the charges entirely.
Dissent
Chief Justice White wrote a dissenting opinion, with which Justice Holmes concurred. The dissenters asserted that constitutional provisions should not be allowed to "progress" so as to include what they were not intended to include. Regarding the particular constitutional provision in question, the dissenters characterized the Court's opinion as follows: "the clause against cruel punishments, which was intended to prohibit inhumane and barbarous bodily punishments, is so construed as to limit the discretion of the lawmaking power in determining the mere severity with which punishments not of the prohibited character may be prescribed." Justices White and Holmes did not object to extending the Eighth Amendment so as to ban newly devised bodily punishments that are inhumane and barbarous; instead they contended that "the prohibition against the infliction of cruel bodily torture cannot be extended so as to limit legislative discretion in prescribing punishment for crime by modes and methods which are not embraced within the prohibition against cruel bodily punishment."
Citation regarding 'Enduring Constitutional Rights', including privacy
"Legislation, both statutory and constitutional, is enacted, it is true, from an experience of evils but its general language should not, therefore, be necessarily confined to the form that evil had theretofore taken. Time works changes, brings into existence new conditions and purposes. Therefore a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth. This is peculiarly true of Constitutions. They are not ephemeral enactments, designed to meet passing occasions. They are, to use the words of Chief Justice Marshall, 'designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it.'" (Weems v. United States (1910) 217 U.S. 349, 373)

From "Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld" ==> """
Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636 (1975), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which unanimously held that the gender-based distinction under  of the Social Security Act of 1935—which permitted widows but not widowers to collect special benefits while caring for minor children—violated the right to equal protection secured by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.. 
 Background 
Stephen Wiesenfeld and Paula Polatschek were married in 1970.  Stephen ran a minicomputer consulting business and had an irregular income.  Paula taught mathematics at Edison High School and earned significantly more than her husband.   When Paula died in childbirth from an amniotic embolism, Stephen became the sole provider for their newborn son, Jason.  To take care of his son, Stephen cut his work hours and sought child care.  Wiesenfeld contested his ineligibility for Social Security survivors' benefits that were made available to widows, but not to widowers. Caspar Weinberger, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (1973-75), appealed the case to the Supreme Court.
Rutgers Law School professor Ruth Bader Ginsburg, along with Melvin Wulf, took on Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld after several unfavorable Supreme Court decisions on gender discrimination cases.  In 1974, Kahn v. Shevin had upheld differences in property tax exemption between widows and widowers, and the Supreme Court ruled in Geduldig v. Aiello that denying compensation from work loss due to pregnancy did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.  Ginsburg looked to Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld to promote the idea of "the care of two loving parents, rather than just one."
Ginsburg made the argument that Section 402(g) of the Social Security Act discriminated against Stephen Wiesenfeld by not providing him with the same survivors' benefits as it would to a widow.  Further, Ginsburg argued that Paula's contributions to Social Security were not treated on an equal basis to salaried men, so she was also being discriminated against.
 Decision 
All of the Eight sitting justices voted in favor of Wiesenfeld, while Justice Douglas was not sitting due to illness. They declared that Section 402(g) of the Social Security Act was unconstitutional on the grounds that the gender based distinctions violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 
Justice Brennan wrote in the Court's opinion:
The Court differentiated the Social Security matter from the decision in Kahn v. Shevin.  The court decided that Section 402(g):
 Subsequent developments 
Wiesenfeld himself received no monetary benefits from the decision.  By the time he initiated the case, he had shut down his consulting business and obtained a well-paid position at a computer company.  His salary thus exceeded the income cutoff for receiving Social Security benefits.
Ginsburg helped highlight the idea that the social security provision had discriminated against men acting as caregivers, and women serving as breadwinners.  Brennan ruled that "such a gender-based generalization cannot suffice to justify the denigration...of women who do work and whose earnings contribute significantly to their families' support." The decision aimed to establish that it is just as important for a child to be cared for by the male parent, as they will encounter the same difficulties in parenting as the female parent.  The court's ruling challenged the traditional male breadwinner/female homemaker model in terms of allocating government benefits. This case gave widowed men the opportunities to collect Social Security for their dependent children, which was only allowed for widowed mothers to collect before this court case. Like men, women could now have their Social Security benefit their families if they died. Though Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld was considered a victory for feminists, the court still was unclear on distinguishing between sex-based classifications that were damaging to women and those that nurtured sexual equality.  Gender based social security questions would continue to be explored further in cases such as Califano v. Goldfarb, which Ginsburg was also involved in, and later in Califano v. Webster, for which Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld had helped lay important groundwork.

From "Weiss v. United States" ==> """
Weiss v. United States, 510 U.S. 163 (1994), is a Supreme Court of the United States case which held that commissioned military officers, who are appointed by the president of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, may be assigned to act as military judges without the need to be confirmed a second time by the Senate.
 Background 
The petitioner Eric J. Weiss was a member of the United States Marine Corps who pled guilty to one count of larceny in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Upon review, the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review affirmed the conviction.
Weiss appealed to the Court of Military Appeals, arguing the judges in his case had no authority to convict him because they had not been properly appointed under the Appointments Clause. The military trial judge who presided over his case was assigned to the same by the case by the Judge Advocate General of the service from among those United States military officers appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Weiss argued the assignment was invalid and that the military judge was required to be appointed by the President rather than assigned by the Judge Advocate General. The Court of Military Appeals rejected this argument, affirmed his conviction.
 Decision 
A unanimous Supreme Court ruled against Weiss, holding the method of appointment of the military judge was constitutional. The Court began by ruling that military judges are officers of the United States because they exercise significant authority under the laws of the United States and, therefore, must be appointed in conformity with the Appointments Clause. However, all military judges, as military officers, are appointed by the President and confirmed the Senate. Weiss argued that, prior, to assuming duties as a military judge, the military officer had to be reappointed. The Court rejected this argument, holding that military officers may be assigned to different duties within the military without running afoul of the Appointments Clause as long as the new assignment is germane to the office for which they were originally appointed. As all military officer have a duty to exercise control over the armed forces, serving a military judge was germane.

From "Welch v. Helvering" ==> """
Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111 (1933), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court on the difference between business and personal expenses and the difference between ordinary business deductions and capital expenses. It is one of the most important income tax law cases.
Background
Thomas Welch and his father owned a grain brokerage business in Minnesota, which went bankrupt in 1922. Welch later reopened a business. He chose to repay his discharged debts. He then tried to deduct the repayments as business expenses, but the Commissioner ruled that these payments were not deductible from income as ordinary and necessary expenses in the course of business.
Opinion of the Court
Benjamin N. Cardozo, delivering the Court's opinion, held that the expenses were too personal, were too bizarre to be ordinary, and were capital. He did not consider them "ordinary and necessary business expenses" and, therefore, not deductible under Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code.
This case is frequently cited for its dictum describing the meaning of the term "necessary" in Section 162 as requiring that expenses merely be "appropriate and helpful [in] the development of the [taxpayer's] business." Cardozo submits that determining what constitutes a necessary expense can be enormously difficult: "life in all its fullness must supply the answer to the riddle."
The court also considered the question of whether Welch's expenses were current expenses or investments which should have been capitalized. Although the case was eventually decided on other grounds, the idea that the expenses should have increased the basis of the business as capital expenses, with no immediate deduction but the potential for depreciation losses over time may also have influenced the court.

From "Welch v. Swasey" ==> """
Welch v. Swasey, 214 U.S. 91 (1909), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that the statutes of Massachusetts, chap. 333 of the Acts of 1904, and chap. 383 of the Acts of 1905, limiting the height of buildings in a certain quarter of a city, do not violate the Constitution of the United States.
Francis C. Welch owned property in a residential section of Boston where building height was legislatively limited to . In other, more commercial sections of the city, the legislation permitted building height up to . After he was denied a permit to construct a  building on his property, Welch sued, contending “that the purposes of the acts are not such as justify the exercise of what is termed the police power, because, in fact, their real purpose was of an aesthetic nature, designed purely to preserve architectural symmetry and regular skylines.”
Delivering the opinion of the Court, Justice Rufus Wheeler Peckham acknowledged Welch's claim that “there is here a discrimination or classification between sections of the city,” but nonetheless adopted a standard of review very deferential to local government. “If the means employed, pursuant to the statute, have no real, substantial relation to a public object which government can accomplish, if the statutes are arbitrary and unreasonable, and beyond the necessities of the case, the courts will declare their invalidity,” wrote Peckham, also expressing that the Court “feels the greatest reluctance in interfering with the well-considered judgments of the courts of a state whose people are to be affected by the operation of the law.”
The reason for this reluctance was the Court's sense that, in such cases, the decision was location specific: “[t]he particular circumstances prevailing at the place or in the state where the law is, to become operative … are all matters which the state court is familiar with; but a like familiarity cannot be ascribed to this court.” Although not entitled to absolute deference, such a state court judgment “is entitled to the very greatest respect, and will only be interfered with, in cases of this kind, where the decision is, in our judgment, plainly wrong.”

Welch v. United States, 578 U.S. 120 (2016), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that the decision in Johnson v. United StatesJohnson v. United States, . announced a substantive rule change and is therefore retroactive.
 Background 
United States law prohibits convicted felons from possessing a firearm.. The maximum sentence for a felon convicted under this statute is 10 years, but the sentence is enhanced to a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life imprisonment if the felon had three or more prior convictions for drug or violent felonies... The Armed Career Criminal Act defines "violent felony" as: ...any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year...that—any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . that— (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another..
Gregory Welch plead guilty to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in 2010. The presentence report claimed that Welch had previously been convicted of three violent felonies, and thus was subject to the enhanced sentence of at least 15 years in prison under the Armed Career Criminal Act. The District Court overruled Welch's objection that one of the three offenses was not a violent offense, stating that it was a violent felony under both the element clause ((i) above) and the residual clause ((ii) above). Welch was then sentenced to 15 years in prison. Welch appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which ruled that the offense was a violent felony under the residual clause, but did not decide whether it qualified under the element clause. The Supreme Court denied certiorari in 2013, making the sentence final..
Welch then entered a habeas corpus challenge, claiming that the strong arm robbery conviction, one of the three prior felonies, was impermissibly vague, which the District Court denied. It further refused to grant a certificate of appealability. He then sought a certificate of appealability from the Court of Appeals, noting that Johnson was pending before the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals denied the certificate. Three weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled in Johnson v. United States that the residual clause, under which Welch was sentenced, was unconstitutional. Welch then submitted a motion to the Court of Appeals for more time to ask for reconsideration, but it was not filed as the time to seek reconsideration had passed. Continuing pro se (i.e., without a lawyer), Welch filed a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court. Welch later retained Supreme Court lawyer Amir H. Ali to represent him, and the Supreme Court granted review.
 Oral argument 
The Supreme Court expedited the briefing process so that the case could be heard and decided within the same term that certiorari was granted. Ali presented oral argument on behalf of Welch, in his first Supreme Court argument. Michael Dreeben, then Deputy Solicitor General of the United States, presented argument on behalf of the United States and conceded that Johnson is retroactive. As the United States had conceded error, the Supreme Court appointed Helgi C. Walker as an amicus curiae to argue in support of the lower court's ruling.
At oral argument, Welch and the United States argued that Johnson should be considered retroactive. The Court has previously held that only "substantive" rule changes are considered retroactive while "procedural" changes are not. Welch argued that because the effect of the Johnson ruling was to change the sentence range, the law should be considered substantive (and thus retroactive). Walker, arguing against retroactivity as an amicus, advanced the argument that, since the source of the ruling was a procedural constitutional provision, Johnson should not be held as retroactive.
 Opinion of the Court 
In a 7–1 decision authored by Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court ruled that Johnson announced a substantive rule change and was thus retroactive. The decision also held that the lower courts had erred in denying a certificate of appealability, as reasonable jurists could disagree on the outcome given the decision in Johnson.
The lone dissenter was Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote that the majority had undermined "any principled limitation on the finality of federal convictions".

From "Welsh v. Wisconsin" ==> """
Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740 (1984), was a 1983 case before the US Supreme Court determining that a warrantless arrest violates the Fourth Amendment protection against unlawful search and seizure.
Facts
On the evening of April 24, 1978, an unknown person was seen driving a car erratically, and the car eventually swerved off the road and came to a stop on an open field. No damage to any people or property was reported or witnessed. A passerby named Randy Jablonic drove to the car, and parked his truck behind the car to prevent the driver from going back to the highway. A woman stopped near the scene and Jablonic asked her to call the police. Before the police arrived, the driver exited his car and asked him for a ride. Jablonic suggested to him that they both wait for police and road side assistance to remove or repair the car.  The driver, instead, ignored his request and walked away. When the police arrived, an officer had questioned Jablonic. Jablonic specifically told the officer that the driver either looked "very inebriated or very sick" The officer then identified the driver as Edward G. Welsh from the registration of the abandoned car. The same officer noticed that Welsh's house was within walking distance  from the scene.  Without securing an arrest or search warrant, the police went to Welsh's house at about 9:00 pm and knocked  on the door. Welsh's stepdaughter answered the door, but the issue of whether she gave consent to the officers' entry was unresolved (and for the purposes of this case, the court assumed that consent was not given). The officers found Welsh  upstairs in his bedroom, where he was in his bed, naked.  The police then arrested him for driving while under the influence of an intoxicant. As he was taken to the police station, he refused to take a breathalyzer test. Under the relevant Wisconsin DUI statute, a first offense was a noncriminal violation subject to a civil forfeiture proceeding for a maximum fine of $300.
Trial and Appeals
Welsh had two separate proceedings. One proceeding was for him refusing the breathalyzer test, since under Wisconsin law, a hearing had to be provided in order to determine whether the test was justified or not. The second proceeding was for the alleged offense itself. Before the refusal hearing was held, Welsh was charged with violating the Wisconsin DUI statute. Welsh filed a pre-trial motion, demanding that the charge against him be dismissed, arguing that his arrest was in itself, invalid, due to him not being in a vehicle at the time of arrest. The trial court denied the motion on July 1980. The refusal hearing was not held until September 1980, which also ruled against Welsh. His license was suspended for 60 days. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals vacated the order, on the grounds that although probable cause was established, the trial court did not effectively establish exigent circumstances. Therefore, Welsh's refusal was considered reasonable, and his suspension was overturned. The Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeals, reasoning that,"
 The foregoing evidence, when myopically parsed, may not individually support a finding of probable cause. When examined collectively, however, it unquestionably indicates "that quantum of evidence which would lead a reasonable police officer to believe that the defendant [driver] probably [violated the statute prohibiting driving while under the influence of an intoxicant]."[7]State v. Cheers, 102 Wis. 2d at 386; see Henry v. United States, supra; secs. 345.22 and 346.63(1), Stats. 1977. The evidence in this case clearly demonstrates that the trial court was correct in ruling that the state had met its burden.
In considering the governmental interest, it is appropriate to note that driving under the influence is a pervasive problem of substantial proportion. In Wisconsin in 1981, there was a 5 percent increase in drunken driving convictions from 1980.[8] Further, approximately 50 percent *335 of all drivers killed in Wisconsin were driving while legally intoxicated.[9] The increasing number of fatalities caused by drunken drivers has aroused state legislatures to adopt stricter penalties in the forms of substantial fines, imprisonment, and license suspensions to punish those who violate the laws prohibiting driving while under the influence of an intoxicant.[10]."
"Frequently, proof that the officer is in hot pursuit of the suspect constitutes exigency. The hot pursuit doctrine evolved to encompass situations where time was of the essence. In other words, when requiring the police to obtain a warrant would constitute undue delay, the hot pursuit doctrine is applicable. In this case, time was of the essence. The inherent nature of the offense demanded the suspect's immediate apprehension to accommodate the dictates of the blood alcohol test statute. Section 343.305(2) (a), Stats. 1977. In order for the officer to enforce the statutory requisites, the situation demanded his immediate search for and pursuit of the suspect.
The defendant, fearful of the officer's impending arrival and perhaps recognizing the possibility of being requested to submit to a blood alcohol test, left the scene of the accident upon discovering that the officer had been summoned. Fleeing to his home, in an attempt to avoid a confrontation with the officer, the defendant's hasty departure resulted in the abandonment of his car. If the officer had retreated and sought to obtain a warrant, rather than immediately pursuing and arresting the suspect, the requirements of the blood alcohol statutes would have been frustrated.
The imminent threat to safety doctrine also constitutes exigent circumstances. The sole purpose of the blood alcohol *337 test is to facilitate prosecution of those driving while under the influence of an intoxicant. See sec. 343.305(2) (a) and 346.63(1), Stats. 1977. Further, sec. 345.24, Stats. 1977, provides that a person arrested for driving while under the influence of an intoxicant "may not be released until four hours have elapsed."[11] This severe treatment is dramatic evidence of the legislature's intent and recognition of the need to protect the public from drunken drivers. Undoubtedly, this provision was enacted to prevent drunken drivers from returning to the road while intoxicated. Presumably, this four-hour statutory limitation sought to provide an adequate time allowance for the arrested intoxicant's blood alcohol content to metabolize to a safer level, equal to or less than .05 percent. Restraining those drivers who pose a danger to themselves and the public for the four-hour statutory period constitutes a preventive measure, designed to promote public safety.
The officer concluded that he had probable cause to believe that the defendant had been operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant. Accordingly, the situation demanded the officer's prompt attempt to locate the defendant. An arrest would prevent the driver from returning to his, or another automobile, where he could have continued to drive in his current state, posing a danger to himself and the public. Consequently, the nature of this offense, coupled with the potential *338 threat to the public safety, satisfied the exigent circumstances test pursuant to the imminent threat to safety doctrine.
An equally persuasive argument is the probable destruction of evidence. This is a model case demonstrating the urgency involved in arresting the suspect in order to preserve evidence of the statutory violation. "Sometimes the nature of the evidence will be such that it will soon disappear of its own accord." 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure, sec. 6.5 at 448 (1978). "Blood rapidly metabolizes alcohol after a person ceases drinking; thus creating an exigent situation." State v. Bentley, 92 Wis. 2d 860, 864, 286 N.W.2d 153 (Ct. App. 1979). Without an immediate blood alcohol test, highly reliable and persuasive evidence facilitating the state's proof of the defendant's alleged violation of sec. 346.63(1), Stats. 1977, would be destroyed. See sec. 343.305(2) (a), Stats. 1977. Accordingly, the facts of this case adhere to the presumption favoring warrantless arrests which are a result "of an ongoing investigation in the field," rather than an arrest that had been planned. W. LaFave, supra, sec. 6.1 at 391.[12]."State v. Welsh Wisconsin Supreme Court text
Holding
The Court decided 6-2 (Burger filed a separate statement against the writ) that Welsh's arrest and suspension of his license  was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Justice William Brennan authored the majority opinion, stating that,"
 It is axiomatic that the "physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed." United States v. United States District Court, 407 U. S. 297, 407 U. S. 313 (1972). And a principal protection against unnecessary intrusions into private dwellings is the warrant requirement imposed by the Fourth Amendment on agents of the government who seek to enter the home for purposes of search or arrest. See Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 333 U. S. 13-14 (1948). [Footnote 10] It is not surprising, therefore,
Page 466 U. S. 749
that the Court has recognized, as
"a 'basic principle of Fourth Amendment law[,]' that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable."
Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. at 445 U. S. 586. See Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, 403 U. S. 474-475 (1971) ("a search or seizure carried out on a suspect's premises without a warrant is per se unreasonable, unless the police can show . . . the presence of exigent circumstances'"). See also Michigan v. Clifford, 464 U. S. 287, 464 U. S. 296-297 (1984) (plurality opinion); Steagald v. United States, 451 U. S. 204, 451 U. S. 211-212 (1981); McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451, 335 U. S. 456 (1948); Johnson v. United States, supra, at 333 U. S. 13-15; Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 116 U. S. 630 (1886).
Consistently with these long-recognized principles, the Court decided in Payton v. New York, supra, that warrantless felony arrests in the home are prohibited by the Fourth Amendment, absent probable cause and exigent circumstances. Id. at 445 U. S. 583-590. At the same time, the Court declined to consider the scope of any exception for exigent circumstances that might justify warrantless home arrests, id. at 445 U. S. 583, thereby leaving to the lower courts the initial application of the exigent circumstances exception. [Footnote 11] Prior decisions of this Court, however, have emphasized that exceptions to the warrant requirement are "few in number and carefully delineated," United States v. United States District Court, supra, at 407 U. S. 318, and that the police bear a heavy burden
Page 466 U. S. 750
when attempting to demonstrate an urgent need that might justify warrantless searches or arrests. Indeed, the Court has recognized only a few such emergency conditions, see, e.g., United States v. Santana, 427 U. S. 38, 427 U. S. 42-43 (1976) (hot pursuit of a fleeing felon); Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 387 U. S. 298-299 (1967) (same); Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 384 U. S. 770-771 (1966) (destruction of evidence); Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U. S. 499, 436 U. S. 509 (1978) (ongoing fire), and has actually applied only the "hot pursuit" doctrine to arrests in the home, see Santana, supra.
Our hesitation in finding exigent circumstances, especially when warrantless arrests in the home are at issue, is particularly appropriate when the underlying offense for which there is probable cause to arrest is relatively minor. Before agents of the government may invade the sanctity of the home, the burden is on the government to demonstrate exigent circumstances that overcome the presumption of unreasonableness that attaches to all warrantless home entries. See Payton v. New York, supra, at 445 U. S. 586. When the government's interest is only to arrest for a minor offense, [Footnote 12] that presumption of unreasonableness is difficult to rebut, and the government usually should be allowed to make such arrests only with a warrant issued upon probable cause by a neutral and detached magistrate.
This is not a novel idea. Writing in concurrence in McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 (1948), Justice Jackson explained why a finding of exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless home entry should be severely restricted when only a minor offense has been committed:
Page 466 U. S. 751
"Even if one were to conclude that urgent circumstances might justify a forced entry without a warrant, no such emergency was present in this case. This method of law enforcement displays a shocking lack of all sense of proportion. Whether there is reasonable necessity for a search without waiting to obtain a warrant certainly depends somewhat upon the gravity of the offense thought to be in progress as well as the hazards of the method of attempting to reach it. . . . It is to me a shocking proposition that private homes, even quarters in a tenement, may be indiscriminately invaded at the discretion of any suspicious police officer engaged in following up offenses that involve no violence or threats of it. While I should be human enough to apply the letter of the law with some indulgence to officers acting to deal with threats or crimes of violence which endanger life or security, it is notable that few of the searches found by this Court to be unlawful dealt with that category of crime. . . . While the enterprise of parting fools from their money by the 'numbers' lottery is one that ought to be suppressed, I do not think its suppression is more important to society than the security of the people against unreasonable searches and seizures. When an officer undertakes to act as his own magistrate, he ought to be in a position to justify it by pointing to some real immediate and serious consequences if he postponed action to get a warrant."
Id. at 335 U. S. 459-460 (footnote omitted).
Consistently with this approach, the lower courts have looked to the nature of the underlying offense as an important factor to be considered in the exigent circumstances calculus. In a leading federal case defining exigent circumstances, for example, the en banc United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit recognized that the gravity of the underlying offense was a principal factor
Page 466 U. S. 752
to be weighed. Dorman v. United States, 140 U.S.App.D.C. 313, 320, 435 F.2d 385, 392 (1970). [Footnote 13] Without approving all of the factors included in the standard adopted by that court, it is sufficient to note that many other lower courts have also considered the gravity of the offense an important part of their constitutional analysis.
For example, courts have permitted warrantless home arrests for major felonies if identifiable exigencies, independent of the gravity of the offense, existed at the time of the arrest. Compare United States v. Campbell, 581 F.2d 22 (CA2 1978) (allowing warrantless home arrest for armed robbery when exigent circumstances existed), with Commonwealth v. Williams, 483 Pa. 293, 396 A.2d 1177 (1978) (disallowing warrantless home arrest for murder due to absence of exigent circumstances). But of those courts addressing the issue, most have refused to permit warrantless home arrests for nonfelonious crimes. See, e.g., State v. Gertin, 190 Conn.440, 453, 461 A.2d 963, 970 (1983) ("The [exigent circumstances] exception is narrowly drawn to cover cases of real, and not contrived, emergencies. The exception is limited to the investigation of serious crimes; misdemeanors are excluded"); People v. Strelow, 96 Mich.App. 182, 190-193, 292 N.W.2d 517, 521-522 (1980). See also People v. Sanders, 59 Ill.App.3d 6, 374 N.E.2d 1315 (1978) (burglary without weapons not grave offense of violence for this purpose); State v. Bennett, 295 N.W.2d 5 (S.D.1980) (distribution of controlled substances not a grave offense for these purposes). But cf. State v. Penas, 200 Neb. 387, 263 N.W.2d 835 (1978) (allowing warrantless home arrest upon hot pursuit from commission of misdemeanor in the officer's presence; decided before Payton); State v. Niedermeyer, 48 Ore.App. 665, 617
Page 466 U. S. 753
P.2d 911 (1980) (allowing warrantless home arrest upon hot pursuit from commission of misdemeanor in the officer's presence). The approach taken in these cases should not be surprising. Indeed, without necessarily approving any of these particular holdings or considering every possible factual situation, we note that it is difficult to conceive of a warrantless home arrest that would not be unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment when the underlying offense is extremely minor.
We therefore conclude that the common-sense approach utilized by most lower courts is required by the Fourth Amendment prohibition on "unreasonable searches and seizures," and hold that an important factor to be considered when determining whether any exigency exists is the gravity of the underlying offense for which the arrest is being made. Moreover, although no exigency is created simply because there is probable cause to believe that a serious crime has been committed, see Payton, application of the exigent circumstances exception in the context of a home entry should rarely be sanctioned when there is probable cause to believe that only a minor offense, such as the kind at issue in this case, has been committed.
Application of this principle to the facts of the present case is relatively straightforward. The petitioner was arrested in the privacy of his own bedroom for a noncriminal, traffic offense. The State attempts to justify the arrest by relying on the hot-pursuit doctrine, on the threat to public safety, and on the need to preserve evidence of the petitioner's blood alcohol level. On the facts of this case, however, the claim of hot pursuit is unconvincing, because there was no immediate or continuous pursuit of the petitioner from the scene of a crime. Moreover, because the petitioner had already arrived home, and had abandoned his car at the scene of the accident, there was little remaining threat to the public safety. Hence, the only potential emergency claimed by the State was the need to ascertain the petitioner's blood alcohol level.
Page 466 U. S. 754
Even assuming, however, that the underlying facts would support a finding of this exigent circumstance, mere similarity to other cases involving the imminent destruction of evidence is not sufficient. The State of Wisconsin has chosen to classify the first offense for driving while intoxicated as a noncriminal, civil forfeiture offense for which no imprisonment is possible. See Wis.Stat. § 346.65(2) (1975); § 346.65(2)(a) (Supp.1983–1984); supra at 466 U. S. 746. This is the best indication of the State's interest in precipitating an arrest, and is one that can be easily identified both by the courts and by officers faced with a decision to arrest. See n 6, supra. Given this expression of the State's interest, a warrantless home arrest cannot be upheld simply because evidence of the petitioner's blood alcohol level might have dissipated while the police obtained a warrant. [Footnote 14] To allow a warrantless home entry on these facts would be to approve unreasonable police behavior that the principles of the Fourth Amendment will not sanction."Full Welsh v. Wisconsin text
Analysis
 When the government’s interest is only to arrest for a minor offense, that presumption of unreasonableness is difficult to rebut, and the government usually should be allowed to make such arrests only with a warrant issued upon probable cause by a neutral and detached magistrate.
 An important factor to be considered when determining whether any exigency exists is the gravity of the underlying offense for which the arrest is being made. Exception to a home entry should rarely be sanctioned.
 Evidence of petitioner’s blood-alcohol level may dissipate is not sufficient here since the minor offense is insufficiently substantial to justify warrantless in-home arrests under exigent circumstances (where dissent disagrees).
Blackmun's concurrence
Justice Harry Blackmun concurred, agreeing with the majority opinion, but argued that the Wisconsin statute should be changed, claiming that,"
 I join the Court's opinion but add a personal observation.
I yield to no one in my profound personal concern about the unwillingness of our national consciousness to face up to—and to do something about—the continuing slaughter upon our Nation's highways, a good percentage of which is due to drivers who are drunk or semi-incapacitated because of alcohol or drug ingestion. I have spoken in these Reports to this point before. Perez v. Campbell, 402 U. S. 637, 402 U. S. 657, and 402 U. S. 672 (1971) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part); Tate v. Short, 401 U. S. 395, 401 U. S. 401 (1971) (concurring opinion). See also South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U. S. 553, 459 U. S. 555-559 (1983).
And it is amazing to me that one of our great States—one which, by its highway signs, proclaims to be diligent and emphatic in its prosecution of the drunken driver—still classifies driving while intoxicated as a civil violation that allows only a money forfeiture of not more than $300 so long as it is a first offense. Wis.Stat. § 346.65(2)(a) (Supp.1983–1984). The State, like the indulgent parent, hesitates to discipline the spoiled child very much, even though the child is engaging in an act that is dangerous to others who are law abiding and helpless in the face of the child's act. See ante at 466 U. S. 754, n. 14 (citing other statutes). Our personal convenience still weighs heavily in the balance, and the highway deaths and
Page 466 U. S. 756
injuries continue. But if Wisconsin and other States choose by legislation thus to regulate their penalty structure, there is, unfortunately, nothing in the United States Constitution that says they may not do so."
White's dissent
Justice Byron White filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice William Rehnquist, arguing that the State of Wisconsin's interest to combat drunk driving, along with Welsh's behavior, was in line with the Fourth Amendment, Welsh did not use the exclusionary rule when it came to the breathalyzer test,  A test relying on exigent circumstances to weigh the gravity of the crime would hamper law enforcement, the Court ignores the benefits of the statute and solely relied on the penalties of the first offense, and that common law justified the arrest ,"
 At common law,
"a peace officer was permitted to arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor or felony committed in his presence as well as for a felony not committed in his presence if there was reasonable ground for making the arrest."
United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 423 U. S. 418 (1976). But the requirement that a misdemeanor must have occurred in the officer's presence to justify a warrantless arrest is not grounded in the Fourth Amendment, see Street v. Surdyka, 492 F.2d 368, 371-372 (CA4 1974); 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure § 5.1 (1978), and we have never held that a warrant is constitutionally required to arrest for nonfelony offenses occurring out of the officer's presence. Thus,
"it is generally recognized today that the common law authority to arrest without a warrant in misdemeanor cases may be enlarged by statute, and this has been done in many of the states."
E. Fisher, Laws of Arrest 130 (1967); see ALI, Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, Appendix X (1975); 1 C. Alexander, The Law of Arrest 445-447 (1949); Wilgus, Arrest Without a Warrant, 22 Mich.L.Rev. 541, 673, 706 (1924).
Wisconsin is one of the States that have expanded the common law authority to arrest for nonfelony offenses. Wisconsin Stat. § 345.22 (Supp.1983–1984) provides that
"[a] person may be arrested without a warrant for the violation of a traffic regulation if the traffic officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is violating or has violated a traffic regulation."
Relying on this statutory authority, officers of the Madison Police Department arrested Edward Welsh in a bedroom in his home for violating Wis.Stat. § 346.63(1) (1977), which proscribes the operation of a motor
Page 466 U. S. 757
vehicle while intoxicated. Welsh refused to submit to a breath or blood test, and his operator's license was eventually revoked for 60 days for this reason pursuant to Wis.Stat. § 343.305 (1975).
In the civil license revocation proceeding, Welsh argued that his arrest in his house without a warrant was unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution, and that his refusal to submit to the test could not be used against him. This contention was not based on the proposition that using the refusal in the revocation proceeding would contravene federal law, but rather rested on the fact that Wis.Stat. § 343.305(2)(b)(5) (1975) had been interpreted to require that an arrest be legal if a refusal to be tested is to be the basis for a license revocation.
On review of the license revocation, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin appears to have recognized that, under the Wisconsin statute, Welsh's license was wrongfully revoked if the officers who arrested him had violated the Federal Constitution. 108 Wis.2d 319, 321 N.W.2d 245 (1982). See Scales v. State, 64 Wis.2d 485, 494, 219 N.W.2d 286, 292 (1974). The court acknowledged that "the individual's right to privacy in the home is a fundamental freedom," and made clear that the State bore the burden of establishing exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless in-home arrest. 108 Wis.2d at 327, 321 N.W.2d at 250. But it discerned a strong state interest in combating driving under the influence of alcohol, id. at 334-335, 321 N.W.2d at 253-254, and held that the warrantless arrest was proper because (1) the officers were in hot pursuit of a defendant seeking to avoid a chemical sobriety test; (2) Welsh posed a potential threat to public safety; and (3) "[w]ithout an immediate blood alcohol test, highly reliable and persuasive evidence facilitating the state's proof of [Welsh's] alleged violation . . . would be destroyed." Id. at 338, 321 N.W.2d at 255. For two reasons, I would not overturn the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.
Page 466 U. S. 758
First, it is not at all clear to me that the important constitutional question decided today should be resolved in a case such as this. Although Welsh argues vigorously that the State violated his federal constitutional rights, he at no point relied on the exclusionary rule, and he does not contend that the Federal Constitution or federal law provides the remedy he seeks. As a general rule, this Court "reviews judgments, not statements in opinions." Black v. Cutter Laboratories, 351 U. S. 292, 351 U. S. 297 (1956). Because the Court does not purport tc hold that federal law requires the conclusion that Welsh's refusal to submit to a sobriety test was reasonable, it is not clear to me how the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin offends federal law.
It is true that, under the Wisconsin statutory scheme, an arrestee's refusal to take a breath or blood test would be reasonable, and would not justify revocation of operating privileges if the underlying arrest violated the Fourth Amendment or was otherwise unlawful. What the State has done, however, is to attach consequences to an arrest found unlawful under the Federal Constitution that we have never decided federal law itself would attach. The Court has occasionally taken jurisdiction over cases in which the States have provided remedies for violations of federally defined obligations. E.g., Moore v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., 291 U. S. 205 (1934). But it has done so in contexts where state remedies are employed to further federal policies. See Greene, Hybrid State Law in the Federal Courts, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 289, 300 (1969). The Fourth Amendment of course applies to the police conduct at issue here. In providing that a driver may reasonably refuse to submit to a sobriety test if he was unlawfully arrested, Wisconsin's Legislature and courts are pursuing a course that they apparently hope will reduce police illegality and safeguard their citizens' rights. Although the State is entitled to draw this conclusion and to implement it as a matter of state law, I am very doubtful that the policies underlying the Fourth Amendment would
Page 466 U. S. 759
require exclusion of the fruits of an illegal arrest in a civil proceeding to remove from the highways a person who insists on driving while under the influence of alcohol. If that is the case—if it would violate no federal policy to revoke Welsh's license even if his arrest was illegal—there is no satisfactory reason for us to review the Supreme Court of Wisconsin's judgment affirming the revocation, even if that court mistakenly applied the Fourth Amendment. For me, this is ample reason not to disturb the judgment.
In any event, I believe that the state court properly construed the Fourth Amendment. It follows from Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573 (1980), that warrantless nonfelony arrests in the home are prohibited by the Fourth Amendment absent probable cause and exigent circumstances. Although I continue to believe that the Court erred in Payton in requiring exigent circumstances to justify warrantless in-home felony arrests, id. at 445 U. S. 603 (WHITE, J., dissenting), I do not reject the obvious logical implication of the Court's decision. But I see little to commend an approach that looks to "the nature of the underlying offense as an important factor to be considered in the exigent circumstances calculus." Ante at 466 U. S. 751.
The gravity of the underlying offense is, I concede, a factor to be considered in determining whether the delay that attends the warrant-issuance process will endanger officers or other persons. The seriousness of the offense with which a suspect may be charged also bears on the likelihood that he will flee and escape apprehension if not arrested immediately. But if, under all the circumstances of a particular case, an officer has probable cause to believe that the delay involved in procuring an arrest warrant will gravely endanger the officer or other persons or will result in the suspect's escape, I perceive no reason to disregard those exigencies on the ground that the offense for which the suspect is sought is a "minor" one.
Page 466 U. S. 760
As a practical matter, I suspect, the Court's holding is likely to have a greater impact in cases where the officer acted without a warrant to prevent the imminent destruction or removal of evidence. If the evidence the destruction or removal of which is threatened documents only the suspect's participation in a "minor" crime, the Court apparently would preclude a finding that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless arrest. I do not understand why this should be so.
A warrantless home entry to arrest is no more intrusive when the crime is "minor" than when the suspect is sought in connection with a serious felony. The variable factor, if there is one, is the governmental interest that will be served by the warrantless entry. Wisconsin's Legislature and its Supreme Court have both concluded that warrantless in-home arrests under circumstances like those present here promote valid and substantial state interests. In determining whether the challenged governmental conduct was reasonable, we are not bound by these determinations. But nothing in our previous decisions suggests that the fact that a State has defined an offense as a misdemeanor for a variety of social, cultural, and political reasons necessarily requires the conclusion that warrantless in-home arrests designed to prevent the imminent destruction or removal of evidence of that offense are always impermissible. If anything, the Court's prior decisions support the opposite conclusion. See Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523, 387 U. S. 539-540 (1967); McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451, 335 U. S. 454-455 (1948). See also State v. Pena, 200 Neb. 387, 263 N.W.2d 835 (1978); State v. Niedermeyer, 48 Ore.App. 665, 617 P.2d 911 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1042 (1981).
A test under which the existence of exigent circumstances turns on the perceived gravity of the crime would significantly hamper law enforcement and burden courts with pointless litigation concerning the nature and gradation of various crimes. The Court relies heavily on Justice Jackson's
Page 466 U. S. 761
concurring opinion in McDonald v. United States, supra, which, in minimizing the gravity of the felony at issue there, illustrates that the need for an evaluation of the seriousness of particular crimes could not be confined to offenses defined by statute as misdemeanors. To the extent that the Court implies that the seriousness of a particular felony is a factor to be considered in deciding whether the need to preserve evidence of that felony constitutes an exigent circumstance justifying a warrantless in-home arrest, I think that its approach is misguided. The decision to arrest without a warrant typically is made in the field under less-than-optimal circumstances; officers have neither the time nor the competence to determine whether a particular offense for which warrantless arrests have been authorized by statute is serious enough to justify a warrantless home entry to prevent the imminent destruction or removal of evidence.
This problem could be lessened by creating a bright-line distinction between felonies and other crimes, but the Court—wisely in my view—does not adopt such an approach. There may have been a time when the line between misdemeanors and felonies marked off those offenses involving a sufficiently serious threat to society to justify warrantless in-home arrests under exigent circumstances. But the category of misdemeanors today includes enough serious offenses to call into question the desirability of such line drawing. See ALI, Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedures 131-132 (Prelim.Draft No. 1, 1965) (discussing ultimately rejected provision abandoning "in-presence" requirement for misdemeanor arrests). If I am correct in asserting that a bright-line distinction between felonies and misdemeanors is untenable and that the need to prevent the imminent destruction or removal of evidence of some nonfelony crimes can constitute an exigency justifying warrantless in-home arrests under certain circumstances, the Court's approach will necessitate a case-by-case evaluation of the seriousness of
Page 466 U. S. 762
particular crimes, a difficult task for which officers and courts are poorly equipped.
Even if the Court were correct in concluding that the gravity of the offense is an important factor to consider in determining whether a warrantless in-home arrest is justified by exigent circumstances, it has erred in assessing the seriousness of the civil forfeiture offense for which the officers thought they were arresting Welsh. As the Court observes, the statutory scheme in force at the time of Welsh's arrest provided that the first offense for driving under the influence of alcohol involved no potential incarceration. Wis.Stat. § 346.65(2) (1975). Nevertheless, this Court has long recognized the compelling state interest in highway safety, South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U. S. 553, 459 U. S. 558-559 (1983), the Supreme Court of Wisconsin identified a number of factors suggesting a substantial and growing governmental interest in apprehending and convicting intoxicated drivers and in deterring alcohol-related offenses, 108 Wis.2d at 334-335, 321 N.W.2d at 253-254, and recent actions of the Wisconsin Legislature evince its
"belief that significant benefits, in the reduction of the costs attributable to drunk driving, may be achieved by the increased apprehension and conviction of even first time . . . offenders."
Note, 1983 Wis.L.Rev. 1023, 1053.
The Court ignores these factors, and looks solely to the penalties imposed on first offenders in determining whether the State's interest is sufficient to justify warrantless in-home arrests under exigent circumstances. Ante at 466 U. S. 754. Although the seriousness of the prescribed sanctions is a valuable objective indication of the general normative judgment of the seriousness of the offense, Baldwin v. New York, 399 U. S. 66, 399 U. S. 68 (1970) (plurality opinion), other evidence is available and should not be ignored. United States v. Craner, 652 F.2d 23, 24-27 (CA9 1981); United States v. Woods, 450 F.Supp. 1335, 1340 (Md.1978); Brady v. Blair, 427 F.Supp. 5, 9 (SD Ohio 1976). Although first offenders are subjected
Page 466 U. S. 763
only to civil forfeiture under the Wisconsin statute, the seriousness with which the State regards the crime for which Welsh was arrested is evinced by (1) the fact that defendants charged with driving under the influence are guaranteed the right to a jury trial, Wis.Stat. § 345.43 (1981-1982); (2) the legislative authorization of warrantless arrests for traffic offenses occurring outside the officer's presence, Wis.Stat. § 345.22 (1981-1982); and (3) the collateral consequence of mandatory license revocation that attaches to all convictions for driving under the influence, Wis.Stat. § 343.30(1q) (1981-1982). See also District of Columbia v. Colts, 282 U. S. 63 (1930); United States v. Craner, supra. It is possible, moreover, that the legislature consciously chose to limit the penalties imposed on first offenders in order to increase the ease of conviction and the overall deterrent effect of the enforcement effort. See Comment, 35 Me.L.Rev. 385, 395, n. 35, 399-400, 403 (1983).
In short, the fact that Wisconsin has chosen to punish the first offense for driving under the influence with a fine rather than a prison term does not demand the conclusion that the State's interest in punishing first offenders is insufficiently substantial to justify warrantless in-home arrests under exigent circumstances. As the Supreme Court of Wisconsin observed,
"[t]his is a model case demonstrating the urgency involved in arresting the suspect in order to preserve evidence of the statutory violation."
108 Wis.2d at 338, 321 N.W.2d at 255. We have previously recognized that
"the percentage of alcohol in the blood begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops, as the body functions to eliminate it from the system."
Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 384 U. S. 770 (1966). Moreover, a suspect could cast substantial doubt on the validity of a blood or breath test by consuming additional alcohol upon arriving at his home. In light of the promptness with which the officers reached Welsh's house, therefore, I would hold that the need to prevent the imminent and ongoing destruction of evidence of a serious
Page 466 U. S. 764
violation of Wisconsin's traffic laws provided an exigent circumstance justifying the warrantless in-home arrest. See also e.g., People v. Ritchie, 130 Cal.App.3d 455, 181 Cal.Rptr. 773 (1982); People v. Smith, 175 Colo. 212, 486 P.2d 8 (1971); State v. Findlay, 259 Iowa 733, 145 N.W.2d 650 (1966); State v. Amaniera 132 N.J.Super. 597, 334 A.2d 398 (1974); State v. Osburn, 13 Ore.App. 92, 508 P.2d 837 (1973).
I respectfully dissent."

From "Werckmeister v. American Tobacco Co." ==> """
Werckmeister v. American Tobacco Co., 207 U.S. 375 (1907), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held a copyright holder is limited to one action to collect infringing copies and statutory damages because the act's remedies are penal and must be observed without construction. Additionally, The United States is not required to be a party to copyright infringement litigation.
The Copyright Act of 1870 does not specify what sort of action a litigant must bring to remedy copyright infringement. Werckmeister won an infringement claim against American Tobacco Company and United States Marshalls collected the infringing copies from the company. Werckmeister took American Tobacco Company back to court to get the monetary damages enumerated by the Copyright Act. In the United States, a successful penal (criminal) suit may collect property and money as restitution. Because the Court determined that the infringement damages were penal, Werckmeister had the opportunity to collect the property, as they did, and the money. They were thus limited to only one action to collect both property and money, because the statute only provided for one action.

From "Wesberry v. Sanders" ==> """
Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1 (1964), was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that districts in the United States House of Representatives must be approximately equal in population. Along with Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), it was part of a series of Warren Court cases that applied the principle of "one person, one vote" to U.S. legislative bodies.
Article One of the United States Constitution requires members of the U.S. House of Representatives to be apportioned by population among the states, but it does not specify exactly how the representatives from each state should be elected. The case arose from a challenge to the unequal population of congressional districts in the state of Georgia.
In his majority opinion, which was joined by five other justices, Associate Justice Hugo Black held that Article One required that "as nearly as practicable one man's vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as another's." The decision had a major impact on representation in the House, as many states had districts of unequal population, often to the detriment of urban voters. The United States Senate was unaffected by the decision since the Constitution explicitly grants each state two senators.
Decision
Writing for the Court majority in Wesberry, Justice Black argued that a reading of the debates of the Constitutional Convention demonstrated conclusively that the Framers had meant, in using the phrase “by the People,” to guarantee equality of representation in the election of Members of the House of Representatives.Congressional Districting – United States Constitution
 Dissent 
Writing in dissent, Justice Harlan argued that the statements cited by Justice Black had uniformly been in the context of the Great Compromise. Justice Harlan further argued that the Convention debates were clear to the effect that Article I, § 4, had vested exclusive control over state districting practices in Congress and that the Court action overrode a congressional decision not to require equally populated districts.

From "West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish" ==> """
West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 (1937), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of state minimum wage legislation. The court's decision overturned an earlier holding in Adkins v. Children's Hospital (1923) and is generally regarded as having ended the Lochner era, a period in American legal history during which the Supreme Court tended to invalidate legislation aimed at regulating business.
The case arose when hotel maid Elsie Parrish sued for the difference between her wages and the minimum wage set by the State of Washington. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes upheld the law, ruling that the Constitution permitted the restriction of liberty of contract by state law where such restriction protected the community, health and safety, or vulnerable groups. Associate Justice Owen J. Roberts's decision to join the majority in upholding the law after having favored striking down a state minimum wage law in another case has occasionally been referred to as "the switch in time that saved nine" because it occurred during the debate over the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937.
Facts
Elsie Parrish, a chambermaid working at the Cascadian Hotel in Wenatchee, Washington (owned by the West Coast Hotel Company), along with her husband, sued the hotel for the difference between what she was paid, and the $14.50 per week of 48 hours established as a minimum wage by the Industrial Welfare Committee and Supervisor of Women in Industry, pursuant to Washington state law.  The trial court, using Adkins as precedent, ruled for the defendant. The Washington Supreme Court, taking the case on a direct appeal, reversed the trial court and found in favor of Parrish. The hotel appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Judgment
The Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Hughes, ruled that the Constitution permitted the restriction of liberty of contract by state law where such restriction protected the community, health and safety, or vulnerable groups, as in the case of Muller v. Oregon,. where the Court had found in favor of the regulation of women's working hours. Hughes said the following:
Significance
The West Coast decision heralded the end of the Lochner era, when the US Supreme Court struck down numerous worker and consumer protection laws. During the Lochner era, the Supreme Court's conservative majority held that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed a "freedom of contract," which trumped efforts by legislators to protect workers or consumers.
The doctrine continued to inform the Court's decisions through the Great Depression and the beginning of the New Deal, when it invalidated numerous worker and consumer protections. Just months prior to West Coast, a similar minimum wage law from New York was struck down in Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo. The majority in Morehead consisted of four conservative justices, sometimes called the "Four Horsemen", and a fifth Associate Justice, Owen Josephus Roberts.
In response to the invalidation of so much legislation, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed to change the number of Supreme Court justices, which its opponents characterized as the "court-packing plan", his court reform bill was intended to dilute the influence of the older, anti-New Deal justices.
Justice Roberts' vote to uphold the minimum wage law in West Coast Hotel, coming so soon after his vote to strike down a similar minimum wage law in Morehead, was unexpected and derailed Roosevelt's court reform bill. Many contemporary observers think Roberts' vote was a response to Roosevelt's court-packing plan, but Roberts denied it, and the evidence is mixed.
Chief Justice Hughes stated in his autobiographical notes that Roosevelt's proposal to change the composition of  the court "had not the slightest effect on our [the court's] decision" and that the delay in the ruling, which was caused only by Harlan Fiske Stone's absence, led to false speculation that Roosevelt's proposal had intimidated the court into ruling in favor of Washington's minimum wage law. Both Hughes and Roberts also acknowledged that because of the overwhelming support that had been shown for the New Deal through Roosevelt's re-election in November 1936, Hughes was able to persuade Roberts to stop basing his votes on his own political beliefs and to start siding with him during future decisions on New Deal legislation. In one of his notes from 1936, Hughes wrote that Roosevelt's re-election forced the court to depart from "its fortress in public opinion" and severely weakened its capability to base its rulings on personal or political beliefs.
Roberts had voted in favor of Washington State's minimum wage on December 19, 1936, just two days after oral arguments concluded, and the Court was evenly divided only because pro-New Deal Associate Justice Stone was then absent for illness.
Roberts's move was notoriously referred to as "the switch in time that saved nine." Shortly after leaving the Court, Roberts reportedly burned all of his legal and judicial papers. As a result, there is no significant collection of his manuscript papers, unlike for most other modern Justices. Roberts prepared a short memorandum that discussed his alleged change of stance around the time of the court-packing effort, which he left in the hands of Justice Felix Frankfurter. In his dissenting opinion, Associate Justice Sutherland wrote that "the meaning of the Constitution does not change with the ebb and flow of economic events," a remark that has been read as an admonition aimed at Roberts.

From "West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy" ==> """
West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186 (1994), was a United States Supreme Court case.
Background
Facts
After milk prices plummeted, the Massachusetts Department of Food and Agriculture issued a pricing order that taxed all the raw milk sold by milk dealers to Massachusetts retailers and dispersed the revenue as a subsidy to Massachusetts dairy farmers. The order, which was designed to aid only Massachusetts milk producers, required dealers to pay into a fund monthly payments that were determined by subtracting from $ 15 the monthly federal blend price for 100 pounds of raw milk. Although approximately two-thirds of such milk was produced outside Massachusetts, the entire fund was distributed monthly to Massachusetts dairy farmers according to each farmer's proportionate contribution to the state's total production of raw milk. 
Two licensed Massachusetts milk dealers, who purchased raw milk outside of Massachusetts but did business in Massachusetts, 
refused to make the payments required under the pricing order, and Massachusetts commenced license revocation proceedings against the dealers.
The dealers then sought an injunction against enforcement of the order on the ground that the order violated the Federal Constitution's commerce clause (Art I, 8, cl 3).
Procedural history
The Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, denied relief, and a Massachusetts official conditionally revoked the dealers' licenses.
The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, expressing the view that the local benefits provided to the Massachusetts dairy industry by the pricing order outweighed any incidental burden on interstate commerce, affirmed the Superior Court judgment.415 Mass. 8, 611 N.E. 2d 239
Opinion of the Court
On certiorari, the United States Supreme Court reversed. Justice Stevens wrote for the majority, joined by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg.
He determined that the pricing order violated the commerce clause, where (1) the avowed purpose and undisputed effect of the order were to enable higher-cost Massachusetts dairy farmers to compete with lower-cost dairy farmers in other states; (2) the tax was effectively imposed on only out-of-state products; (3) the order would almost certainly cause local goods to constitute a larger share, and goods with an out-of-state source to constitute a smaller share, of the total sales in the market; (4) by distributing monies directly to Massachusetts dairy farmers, the order insured that Massachusetts producers would benefit; (5) the order was unconstitutional even if (a) the tax on milk sales and the subsidy to Massachusetts dairy farmers would each be constitutional standing alone, (b) the dealers who paid the tax were not competitors of the farmers who received disbursements from the fund, and (c) the costs of the program imposed under the order were borne by only Massachusetts dealers and consumers; and (6) the order's burden on commerce could not be justified by the local benefit preserving the Massachusetts dairy industry.
Negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence had long forbidden state tariffs because they discriminated against interstate commerce by burdening out-of-state competitors to the benefit of in-state businesses. The Court explained that a state could not use its legitimate powers to tax and to subsidize state businesses to effect the illegitimate aim of imposing what was in effect a tariff. The Court held that a nondiscriminatory tax had been coupled with a legitimate subsidy to create an effect that nonetheless violated the Commerce Clause.
Thus, the Court reversed the state supreme court's order, which had upheld a pricing order by the Massachusetts Department of Food and Agriculture to tax milk produced out-of-state and to distribute the proceeds to in-state dairy farmers. The Court held that the order violated the negative Commerce Clause because, like a tariff, it benefitted in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors, such as the milk buyers. 
Concurrence
Justice Scalia, concurred, joined by Justice Thomas.
He argued that (1) a self-executing negative commerce clause should be enforced against a state law that (a) facially discriminates against interstate commerce, or (b) is indistinguishable from a type of law previously held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court; and (2) applying this approach, or at least the second part of it, the pricing order was invalid.
Dissent
Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented, joined by Justice Blackmun.
He stated that no decided case supported the court's conclusion that the negative commerce clause prohibits a state from using money that it has lawfully obtained through a neutral tax on milk dealers and distributing the money as a subsidy to dairy farmers.

From "West v. Barnes" ==> """
West v. Barnes, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 401 (1791), was the first  United States Supreme Court decision and the earliest case calling for oral argument. Van Staphorst v. Maryland (1791) was docketed prior to West v. Barnes but settled before the Court heard the case: West was argued on August 2 and decided on August 3, 1791.  Collet v. Collet (1792) was the first appellate case docketed with the Court but was dropped before it could be heard. Supreme Court Reporter Alexander Dallas did not publish the justices' full opinions in West v. Barnes, which were published in various newspapers around the country at the time, but he published an abbreviated summary of the decision.
The Court ultimately decided the case on procedural grounds, holding that a writ of error (an appeal) must be issued within ten days by the Clerk of the Supreme Court of the United States as required by federal statute, and not by a lower court located closer to the plaintiff in Rhode Island.  As a result of this case, Congress ultimately changed this procedure with the ninth section of the Process and Compensation Act of 1792, allowing circuit courts to issue these writs, thereby assisting citizens living far away from the capital.
Background
This was the first case of judicial review in the United States where the Court had the opportunity to overturn a Rhode Island state statute regarding lodging payment of a debt in paper currency in fulfillment of a contract. The court did not exercise judicial review in deference to the legislature. The court ultimately decided against William West, the petitioner, on procedural grounds.Earliest Cases of Judicial Review of State Legislation by Federal Courts, by Charles Warren, The Yale Law Journal,  1922, pg. 22-23. (accessed through JSTOR)
William West was a farmer, anti-federalist leader, revolutionary war general, and judge from Scituate, Rhode Island.  He owed a mortgage on his farm from a failed molasses deal in 1763 to the Jenckes family from Providence. He made payments on the mortgage for twenty years, and in 1785 asked the state for permission to conduct a lottery to help pay off the remainder.  Due to his service during the Revolution, the state granted him permission. Much of the proceeds were paid in paper currency instead of gold or silver. West tendered payment in the paper currency as allowed by state statute, "lodging" the funds with a state judge to be collected within ten days.
David L. Barnes, a Jenckes heir, and well-known attorney and later federal judge, brought suit in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction asserting that gold or silver payment was required, and refusing the paper currency. Despite lack of formal training, West represented himself pro se in the circuit court in June 1791 before Chief Justice John Jay, Associate Justice William Cushing, and Henry Marchant. They rejected his arguments. West then pursued appeal to the Supreme Court on a writ of error, attempting to comply with all statutory directions. West was unable to make the journey to Philadelphia to represent himself, so he engaged William Bradford, Jr., Pennsylvania's attorney general, to represent him. On appeal, Barnes focused on the procedural irregularities. Barnes asserted that the writ had been signed and sealed only by the clerk of the circuit court in Rhode Island instead of by the Supreme Court clerk, which he claimed as necessary. This was asserted despite the fact that West would have had to make an arduous journey in 1791 to Philadelphia within ten days to do so. West lost on this procedural issue and was eventually forced to relinquish his farm.
Opinions
The court's full opinion was extensively covered by period newspapers as no official court reporter was yet published in 1791, and the seriatim opinions were republished in the newspapers and are currently accessible in James R. Perry's The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800, Volume 6, "West v. Barnes," pp. 3-27. The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800. Each of the five justices issued a seriatim opinion regarding the writ of error, and the justices unsuccessfully looked to common law precedent from state courts and pre-Revolution English case law including Coke and Blackstone's treatises. Several of the justices expressed their reservations about the federal statute and suggested alternatives for filing within the ten-day statutory period, but nevertheless each justice refused to expand the meaning of the statute believing that only Congress had the power to do so. In summation the Dallas reporter quoted John Jay and summed up the case holding as follows:
West, Plaintiff in error, v. Barnes et al.
On the first day of the term, Bradford presented to the court, a writ, purporting to be a writ of error, issued out of the office of the clerk of the circuit court for Rhode Island district, directed to that court, and commanding a return of the judgment and proceedings rendered by them in this cause: And thereupon he moved for a rule, that the defendant rejoin to the errors assigned in this cause.
Barnes, one of the defendants, (a counsellor of the court) objected to the validity of the writ, that it had issued out of the wrong office: and, after argument,
THE COURT were unanimously of opinion, That writs of error to remove causes to this court from inferior courts, can regularly issue only from the clerk's office of the court.

Aftermath
Justice James Iredell was upset by the governing statute and wrote to President Washington to change the law, which allowed only the clerk of the Supreme Court to issue writs of error.

Several months after the decision, on November 9, 1791, Barnes brought another suit of ejectment to eject West from the mortgaged farm. He filed suit in the Circuit Court for the District of Rhode Island. Justice Jay, Justice Cushing and Judge Henry Marchant held the plea bad for a second time. They decided that William West lodged payment of his debt with a Rhode Island judge on September 16, and so Barnes had ten days to collect it, according to the state statute. The Rhode Island "lodging" Act was, however, suspended on the 19th of that month and so the ten-day period could not fully occur since only three days had passed and was thus not conformable to the statute. Barnes eventually won the ejectment case, but he had difficulty ejecting West's family from the farm, as West had sold the farm to a son-in-law. West's estate continued to be disputed after his death, resulting in the First Circuit decision West v. Randall in 1820.
According to Cotter v. Alabama, "Prior to 1791 it was the practice that a writ of error could only issue from the office of the clerk of the supreme court. In Mussina v. Cavazos, ([73, US 355], 6 Wall. 355), it is stated that a decision to that effect in West v. Barnes... led to the enactment of the ninth section of the act of 1792, being section 1004 of the Revised Statutes..." (Cotter v. Alabama G. S. R. Co., 61 F. 747, 748 (6th Cir. 1894)).

From "West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette" ==> """
West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943), is a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court holding that the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment protects students from being forced to salute the American flag or say the Pledge of Allegiance in public school. The court's 6–3 decision, delivered by Justice Robert H. Jackson, is remembered for its forceful defense of free speech and constitutional rights generally as being placed "beyond the reach of majorities and officials".
Barnette overruled a 1940 decision on the same issue, Minersville School District v. Gobitis, in which the court had stated that the proper recourse for dissent was to try to change the public school policy democratically. This overruling was a significant court victory won by Jehovah's Witnesses, whose religion forbade them from saluting or pledging to symbols, including symbols of political institutions. The court did not address the effect the compelled salutation and recital ruling had upon their particular religious beliefs but instead ruled that the state did not have the power to compel speech in that manner for anyone. In overruling Gobitis, the court primarily relied on the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment rather than the Free Exercise Clause.
 Background 
In the 1930s, the leader of the Jehovah's Witnesses, Joseph Franklin Rutherford, began objecting to U.S. state laws requiring school students to salute the flag as a means of instilling patriotism, and in 1936 he declared that baptized Jehovah's Witnesses who did salute the flag were breaking their covenant with God and were committing idolatry.Exodus 20, 4-5: "You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments."  Yearbook, 1936, p. 22, "The saluting of or salutation to a flag means this: 'I depend on what the flag represents for my salvation. Those who know and serve God in spirit and in truth look to Jehovah God for salvation, and not to any man or any man-made organization. It therefore follows that the saluting of any flag by those who are in covenant with Jehovah God to do his will constitutes the breaking of that covenant with God, and such covenant breakers are guilty of death." 
In the United States, children of Jehovah's Witnesses had been expelled from school and were threatened with exclusion for no other cause. Officials threatened to send them to reformatories maintained for criminally inclined juveniles. Parents of such children had been prosecuted and were being threatened with prosecutions for causing delinquency. In 1935, nine-year-old Carlton Nichols was expelled from school and his father arrested in Lynn, Massachusetts, for such a refusal. Additional refusals followed, one such leading to Minersville School District v. Gobitis (1940). Even after the Gobitis decision, Jehovah's Witnesses continued to refuse to say the pledge and continued to be expelled from schools. In 1942, the West Virginia Board of Education formed a regulation that was perceived as directly targeting Jehovah's Witnesses, as it required schoolchildren to salute the flag and extensively quoted the Gobitis case, including "conscientious scruples have not in the long struggle for religious toleration relieved the individual from obedience to the general law not aimed at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs". The West Virginia Supreme Court refused to force the school board from requiring children to salute the flag, which led to the federal lawsuit being filed.
 Facts of the case 
Following the Gobitis decision, the West Virginia Legislature amended its statutes to require all schools in the state to conduct courses of instruction in history, civics, and the constitutions of the United States and of the state "for the purpose of teaching, fostering and perpetuating the ideals, principles and spirit of Americanism, and increasing the knowledge of the organization and machinery of the government". The West Virginia state board of education was directed to "prescribe the courses of study covering these subjects" for public schools.
The board of education on January 9, 1942, adopted a resolution containing recitals taken largely from the Supreme Court's Gobitis opinion and ordering that the salute to the flag become "a regular part of the program of activities in the public schools" and that all teachers and pupils "shall be required to participate in the salute honoring the Nation represented by the Flag; provided, however, that refusal to salute the Flag be regarded as an Act of insubordination, and shall be dealt with accordingly".
The resolution originally required the "commonly accepted salute to the Flag", which it defined. Objections to the salute (the Bellamy salute, see image) as "being too much like Hitler's" were raised by a variety of organizations, including the Parent and Teachers Association, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, the Red Cross, and the General Federation of Women's Clubs. Some modification appears to have been made in deference to these objections, but no concession was made to Jehovah's Witnesses. What was required after the modification was a "stiff-arm" salute, the saluter to keep the right hand raised with palm turned up while the following is repeated: "I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands; one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."

Failure to comply was considered "insubordination" and dealt with by expulsion. Readmission was denied by statute until the student complied. This expulsion, in turn, automatically exposed the child and their parents to criminal prosecution; the expelled child was considered "unlawfully absent" and could be proceeded against as a delinquent, and their parents or guardians could be fined as much as $50 and jailed up to thirty days.
Marie and Gathie Barnett were Jehovah's Witnesses attending Slip Hill Grade School near Charleston, West Virginia, who were instructed by their father not to salute the flag or recite the pledge, and were expelled for their refusal. On the advice of an early attorney, Horace S. Meldahl of Charleston, the Barnetts had avoided the further complications by having their expelled girls return to school each day, though the school would send them home. From April 28, 2006, proceedings cosponsored by the Robert H. Jackson Center and the Supreme Court Historical Society, at the Jackson Center in Jamestown, New York:
Moderator: What was your parents' decision about how to handle this situation: The school has a mandatory flag salute, thanks to the State Education Department regulation, and you have your religious belief?
[Gathie Barnette] Edmonds: When we went home, of course, they understood and they said not to worry about it. And our uncle helped us get a lawyer, Mr. Horace Meldahl in Charleston, who was a very understanding person, a nice person. He told us that we had to go back to school every morning for a while.
Moderator: Why was that?
Edmonds: So they wouldn't fine our dad or put him in jail.
[Marie Barnette] Snodgrass: So they couldn't say we were just being truant. And so we went every morning and stayed until the flag salute, and they'd tell us to go home. It was fortunate that we lived fairly close—we didn't have a long distance to go.
Moderator: And that was the end of the school day for you?
Edmonds: Yes. Once the truant officer came and asked my mother why we weren't in school, and she could say, "Well, we sent 'em and they sent 'em home." So that kind of took, you know, the edge off of them. Our parents didn't keep us home.
The Barnetts brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia for themselves and others similarly situated, asking its injunction to restrain enforcement of these laws and regulations against Jehovah's Witnesses, and prevailed, with the three-judge panel stating:
The school district subsequently appealed.
 Arguments 
The board's argument was that the plaintiffs raised no substantial federal question, and their brief relied extensively on Justice Frankfurter's Gobitis opinion.
Hayden Covington answered the state's appeal in a brief that was a mixture of Jehovah's Witnesses Bible teachings and constitutional arguments. He explicitly called for the overturning of the Gobitis opinion, especially rejecting Justice Frankfurter's deference to legislative policymaking authority. Such deference, he argued, allowed the legislature to define its own powers. He emphasized the nationwide persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses that had followed Gobitis and concluded with a long list of law journal and newspaper articles that criticized the decision. The American Bar Association's Committee on the Bill of Rights and the American Civil Liberties Union filed amicus curiae  briefs that argued Gobitis was bad law and should be overruled.
It was widely expected that Gobitis would be overturned. The resignation of James Byrnes the previous year, and Franklin D. Roosevelt's subsequent appointment of Wiley Rutledge, had created a shift on views of the First Amendment—for instance, the Court overturned a precedent set a mere nine months prior in Jones v. City of Opelika (1942) through its ruling in Murdock v. Pennsylvania (1943).
 Decision of the court 
The court held, in a 6–3 decision delivered by Justice Jackson, that it was unconstitutional for public schools to compel students to salute the flag. It thus overruled its decision in Minersville School District v. Gobitis (1940), finding that the flag salute was "a form of utterance" and "a primitive but effective means of communicating ideas". The court wrote that any "compulsory unification of opinion" was doomed to failure and was antithetical to the values set forth in the First Amendment. The court stated:
The Supreme Court announced its decision on June 14, Flag Day.
 Majority opinion 
The opinion that Justice Felix Frankfurter had authored three years earlier in Gobitis rested on four arguments. In Barnette Justice Jackson addressed each element of Frankfurter's Gobitis decision. Jackson began with Frankfurter's designation of the flag as a national symbol. He did not question Frankfurter's designation of the flag as a national symbol; instead, he criticized the pedestal on which Frankfurter put such national symbols. Jackson called symbols a "primitive but effective way of communicating ideas" and explained that "a person gets from a symbol the meaning he puts into it, and what is one man's comfort and inspiration is another's jest and scorn".
Next, Jackson denied Frankfurter's argument that flag-saluting ceremonies were an appropriate way to build the "cohesive sentiment" that Frankfurter believed national unity depended on. Jackson rejected Frankfurter's argument, citing the Roman effort to drive out Christianity, the Spanish Inquisition of the Jews, and the Siberian exile of Soviet dissidents as evidence of the "ultimate futility" of efforts to coerce unanimous sentiment out of a populace. Jackson warned that  who begin coercive elimination of dissent soon find themselves exterminating dissenters. Compulsory unification of opinion achieves only the unanimity of the graveyard".
Then Jackson dealt with Frankfurter's assertion that forcing students to salute the flag, and threatening them with expulsion if they chose not to, was a permissible way to foster national unity. Jackson's rejection of this section of Frankfurter's argument has proved the most quoted section of his opinion. In his Gobitis opinion Frankfurter's solution was for the dissenters to seek out solutions to their problems at the ballot box. Jackson responded that the conflict, in this case, was between authority and the individual, and that the Founders had intended the Bill of Rights to put some rights out of reach from majorities, ensuring that some liberties would endure beyond political majorities. Jackson wrote:
The last leg of Frankfurter's Gobitis opinion reasoned that matters like saluting the flag were issues of "school discipline" that are better left to local officials rather than federal judges. Justice Jackson rejected this argument as well:
 Concurring opinion 
Two of the justices who changed their minds between Minersville and West Virginia v. Barnette—Hugo Black and William O. Douglas—would become the most ardent supporters of the First Amendment.
Black and Douglas in a concurring opinion:
Words uttered under coercion are proof of loyalty to nothing but self-interest ... Love of country must spring from willing hearts and free minds, inspired by a fair administration of wise laws enacted by the people's elected representatives within the bounds of express constitutional prohibitions.
 Dissenting opinion 
right|thumb|Justice Felix Frankfurter
Three years earlier, seven justices had followed Frankfurter's reasoning and joined his majority opinion in Gobitis. In Barnette, however, only Frankfurter filed a written dissent. Neither Justice Owen Roberts nor Stanley Reed wrote a dissenting opinion.
Frankfurter said that the court was overstepping its bounds in striking down the West Virginia law. He said, too, that freedom of religion did not allow individuals to break laws simply because of religious conscience. Frankfurter argued, "Otherwise each individual could set up his own censor against obedience to laws conscientiously deemed for the public good by those whose business it is to make laws."
Frankfurter's response to Jackson's systematic destruction of his Gobitis decision was one of anger, and Justices Roberts and Murphy tried to get him to revise his opinion, arguing that the first two lines were "much too personal". However, Frankfurter ignored the advice of his fellow justices, taking the overruling of his Gobitis decision as a personal affront and insisting on speaking his mind.
Frankfurter began with a reference to his Jewish roots: "One who belongs to the most vilified and persecuted minority in history is not likely to be insensible to the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution." This was the passage Justices Roberts and Frank Murphy felt was out of place. Frankfurter, however, insisted that the passage was necessary since he claimed he was "literally flooded with letters" following the Court's decision in Gobitis that said he should be more sensitive to the protection of minorities due to his Jewish heritage. Frankfurter's dissent continued, "Were my purely personal attitudes relevant I should wholeheartedly associate myself with the generally libertarian views in the Court's opinion. ... But as judges we are neither Jew nor Gentile, neither Catholic nor agnostic."
Having responded to his critics and the court's reversal on a personal level. He now responded on a judicial one, with the remainder of his opinion focusing on judicial restraint. "As a member of this Court, I am not justified in writing my private notions of policy into the Constitution. ... It can never be emphasized too much that one's own opinion about the wisdom or evil of a law should be excluded altogether when one is doing one's duty on the bench."
Frankfurter continued, arguing that if the court is frequently striking down laws, it is circumventing the democratic process, since the court cannot work to reach a compromise. It either strikes down a law or lets it stand; it cannot simply modify or qualify a law as a legislature can.
Finally, Frankfurter rejected Justice Stone's rational-basis test that Stone laid out in United States v. Carolene Products Co. (1938). Instead, Frankfurter focused on his belief that there were no provisions within the Constitution that occupied a "preferred position" over others.
 Subsequent history 
The majority opinion in Barnette is considered one of the court's greatest and most sweeping statements about the fundamental freedoms established by the Bill of Rights. After Barnette the court began to turn away from the belief–action doctrine (see Reynolds v. United States for discussion) altogether, creating a religious exemption for believers of different creeds. In Sherbert v. Verner (1963), for example, the court upheld a Seventh-day Adventist's claim to unemployment benefits even though she declined to make herself available to work on Saturday (her sabbath) as the law required. In Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972), the court upheld the right of Amish parents not to send their children to public schools past the eighth grade.
In a 2006 proceedings cosponsored by the Justice Robert H. Jackson Center and the Supreme Court Historical Society, Supreme Court law clerks from the Barnette court were on a panel with the two eponymous Barnetts. Just as she and her sister had been in 1942, Gathie Barnett Edmonds noted that her own son was also sent to the principal's office for not saluting the flag. From April 28, 2006 proceedings cosponsored by the Robert H. Jackson Center and the Supreme Court Historical Society, at the Jackson Center in Jamestown, New York, "[The older of the two Barnett girls, Gathie Barnett] Edmonds: ...I remember when my older son was sent to the office for not saluting the flag. The principal came back and said your teacher obviously doesn't remember the Supreme Court decision."

From "West Virginia v. EPA" ==> """
West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency, 597 U.S. ___ (2022), was a U.S. Supreme Court case related to the Clean Air Act and the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate carbon dioxide emissions related to climate change.
The case centers on the Clean Power Plan (CPP) proposed by the EPA in 2015 by the Obama administration. Among the provisions, the CPP had included regulation at existing power plants under Section 7411(d) of Title 42 of the United States Code to implement "within the fence line" emissions reduction technology and "outside the fence line" generation shifting to alternative clean energy sources such as solar and wind power. The generation shifting aspects of the CPP were challenged by several states and coal industry companies, and the CPP was stayed by the courts and never came into enforcement. The Trump administration's EPA put forth a less-aggressive Affordable Clean Power rule in 2019 which was similar and stayed by courts. The stay was challenged by multiple states and coal industry companies, seeking to question the EPA's ability to regulate existing power plants under 7411(d) as proposed in the CPP. The case was not rendered moot when the Biden adminstration took over in 2020, as the EPA under the Biden administration stated their inclination to include "outside the fence line" controls, making the case still relevant to the authority the EPA had in interpreting their Congressional charter.
In a 6–3 ruling issued on June 30, 2022, the Court ruled that the regulation of existing power plants in Section 7411(d) fell under the major questions doctrine, and within that, Congress did not grant the EPA authority to regulate emissions from existing plants based on generation shifting mechanisms, which would have invalidated the Clean Power Plan. The EPA may still continue to regulate emissions at existing plants through emissions reduction technologies.
 Background 
 Clean Air Act 
As part of the amended Clean Air Act (CAA), under § 7411(d) (or Section 111 in the proposed bill), Congress granted the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authority to identify the "best system of emission reduction" from power generating plants or other large stationary sources, and work with states to complete implementation plans to incorporate those systems. This authority was split between two regulations, one covering emissions controls for new plants, outlined at § 7411(b), and another controlling emissions at existing plants, at § 7411(d). Within the scope of § 7411(d), while the EPA itself cannot set taxes or fines on plants that fail to meet emission standards, it can work with states in their implementation plans to force generating plants to install emissions control technology or to participate in emissions trading programs, or allow states to implement their own taxes on violating plants. Compared to the EPA's use of § 7411(b) in overseeing new plants, the EPA had rarely evoked § 7411(d) in any of its rule-making, and thus § 7411(d) realized less legal scrutiny compared to other parts of the Clean Air Act.
 Prior EPA litigation 
One key piece of litigation related to the Clean Air Act was the 2007 Supreme Court case Massachusetts v. EPA, which in a 5–4 decision, had found that the EPA was mandated by Congress to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and can be sued for failing to enact rules to this end under the Clean Air Act. Massachusetts v. EPA was considered one of the most significant cases in environmental litigation, as it allowed for a range of further lawsuits aimed to force emission-producing entities to limit their emissions.
Another relevant piece of litigation was the 2015 Supreme Court case Michigan v. EPA, which in a 5–4 decision held that the EPA must consider costs and that it interpreted the Clean Air Act unreasonably when it determined that it did not need to consider costs when it issued a "finding" that it was "necessary and appropriate" to regulate fossil fuel power plants., U.S. Supreme Court rules on EPA power regs, set to hear public sector union dues case (July 7, 2015) (describing the Court's decision as a "landmark ruling"); , Power Industry Fights EPA Emissions Rules in Supreme Court (March 25, 2015) (describing Michigan v. EPA as a "landmark" case). Michigan v. EPA was considered a controversial case in environmental litigation as it was criticized for minimizing health impacts and signalling a retreat of the Chevron deference, in which the interpretation of congressional legislation made by executive agencies is given deference in judicial court established in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., in administrative law.Brian Lipshutz, Justice Thomas & the Originalist Turn in Administrative Law, 125  94, 100, 101–02 (2015) (internal quotations omitted); see also Sasha Volokh, , Justice Thomas delivers what he promised on February 27, 2001 (March 11, 2015) (describing Justice Thomas' critiques of the delegation doctrine).
 Procedural history 
 Clean Power Plan 
In June 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed The Clean Power Plan (CPP) as an Obama administration rule. The rules aimed to tackle climate change by requiring reductions of carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation by 32% of recorded 2005 levels by 2030, with the implementation to be set by the states, under the authority granted by the Clean Air Act, § 7411(d). States would have been required to submit implementation plans by 2018 with enforcement to start by 2022. States could require existing plants to implement efficiency improvements, emissions controls, or incorporate renewable energy generation; under these rules, existing plants adding these elements could then be subject to a New Source Review by the EPA under § 7411(b), thus assuring older plants then were brought up to standards expected of new power plants. This was part of the United States' commitment towards the Paris Agreement, using amendments introduced in 1990 to the Clean Air Act that identified carbon dioxide as a pollutant. Although the CPP did not go into effect, its goal were met in 2019 due to energy efficiency, construction of wind and solar power, and energy market prices resulting in shifting of generation from coal to gas.
In August 2015, opponents of the CPP, which included 28 states and hundreds of companies, challenged the EPA's authority in its rulemaking of the CPP, filing suit in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) after the rules were published in the Federal Register. Their suit challenged the CPP primarily on three factors. The first related to an oversight during the reconciliation of the Clean Air Act amendment in 1990 which resulted in the House and Senate versions of § 7411(d) to never be reconciled, and both versions were codified into the signed law. The House version had stated that because other parts of the Clean Air Act had covered regulation of carbon dioxide, the EPA could not use § 7411(d) to cover carbon dioxide emissions from existing plants, while the Senate version allowed for § 7411(d) to overlap carbon dioxide emissions coverage. The EPA inferred that they had judicial deference to interpret the law, following the 2015 Supreme Court decision in King v. Burwell, and used the Senate's language to develop the CPP, while opponents believed that the House version was the intended language consistent with other parts of the law.
A second factor raised by opponents of the CPP was that the EPA's rule reached beyond their normal authority by giving states authority to regulate power plants across the board rather than at an individual plant level. Opponents believed that while the EPA or states could have plants take actions like implementing emissions controls as those were within bounds of the plant's control or "within the fenceline", the rules related to efficiency improvements and renewables were considered to be "outside the fenceline". The third factor was related to Tenth Amendment arguments that the EPA was inappropriately delegating federal authority to the states.
In January 2016, the D.C. Circuit agreed to hear the case, though they did not grant a temporary injunction to stay enforcement of the CPP. In February 2016, the Supreme Court ordered a stay in the implementation of the CPP. While the order was unsigned, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan stated they would have denied the request. The D.C. Circuit held an en banc hearing in September 2016.
After the 2016 presidential election and the installation of the Trump administration at the start of 2017, the EPA effectively stated its intent to repeal the Clean Power Plan by March 2017 and to replace it with a new rule that was intended to keep its authority "within the fenceline", and asked the D.C. District to put the case in abeyance.  In April 2017, the D.C. District court granted the abeyance request and granted continued extensions through the year. In October 2017, the EPA formally issued its initial ruling to repeal the CPP, and continued to request the D.C. Circuit to hold the case in abeyance until the rulemaking was finalized. Proponents of the CPP urged the District court to press ahead with ruling from the September 2016, since any delay would allow the EPA to avoid its duty to uphold the Clean Air Act. While the D.C. Circuit did continue to grant additional periods of abeyance through June 2018, the court stated that month that it would no longer grant any further requests to delay the case, requiring the EPA to issue its final rule repealing the CPP and introducing a replacement rule, or to allow the court to continue its review.
 Affordable Clean Energy rule 
With the D.C. Circuit court refusal to grant further abeyance delays, the EPA issued a new proposed set of emissions regulations, the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, in August 2018. These repealed the CPP, with the EPA arguing these were developed on a misplaced use of statutory interpretation of § 7411(d). The ACE rules were developed based the EPA's responsibility established in Massachusetts v. EPA, but only setting minimal safeguards and requirements for such reductions, targeting only a reduction of between 0.7% and 1.5% of carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, compared to the 32% set by the CPP. Further, ACE kept the EPA's regulations to only steps "within the fenceline" of a power plant through emissions controls and lacked any allowance towards efficiency improvements or renewable sources. While power plants that implemented emissions controls would still be subject to a New Sources Review, the ACE rule also aimed to weaken the requirements of this review to make it less rigorous and more likely for older plants to pass without having to upgrade their facilities. EPA analysis estimated this rule would increase particulate pollution compared to what was proposed under CPP, potentially leading to 1,500–3,600 more premature deaths per year by 2030 and up to 15,000 more new cases of upper respiratory problems, among other human health impacts. The EPA argued that these initial rules were based on a limited interpretation of § 7411(d), and that other aspects of the Clean Air Act can be used to address other pollutants to reduce these numbers. With the release of the ACE rule and intent to repeal to the CPP, the D.C. Circuit dismissed the case over the CPP as moot, which subsequently ended the stay on the CPP issued by the Supreme Court. 
The new rules were seen as a boon to the states and companies that had opposed the CPP, particularly by President Donald Trump who saw it as a means to support the failing coal industry, but several other states and public health groups criticized the new rules, putting profits of the fossil fuel sector over public health. Opponents also argued that the 32% reduction target in the CPP had already been met by the time the new ACE was introduced, so the ACE represented a reversal of those gains in reducing emissions. After the final rule was published in June 2019, the American Lung Association and the American Public Health Association filed suit in the D.C. Circuit court to challenge the rule in July 2019. The plaintiffs were joined by over 170 other groups, including twenty three states, several cities, and other public health groups over time. The suit argued that through the ACE rule, the EPA was failing to meet its duty to reduce emissions and improve public health under the Clean Air Act, as well as preventing states from using other long-standing measures such as emissions trading as part of their implementation plans. Oral hearings were heard in October 2020.
The D.C. Circuit ruled 2–1 on January 19, 2021, by happenstance the day before the inauguration of Joe Biden as the next U.S. President, in favor of the plaintiffs, vacating the ACE and its repeal of the CPP. The majority opinion ruled that the EPA's ACE rulemaking was made in a arbitrary and capricious manner intended "to slow the process for reduction of emissions", and that its implementation "hinged on a fundamental misconstruction" of the Clean Air Act's § 7411(d). Because the prior case against the CPP had been rendered moot and the stay against the CPP dismissed, this decision effectively brought the CPP into enforcement, if the EPA chose to continue with it, or to develop a new rule as remanded by the D.C. District court. However, by mid-2021, the Biden administration suggested it was likely seeking an alternate plan than the CPP for carbon dioxide emissions.
 Supreme Court 
Nineteen other states, led by West Virginia, and power companies challenged the D.C. Circuit's ruling, asserting that the decision gives the EPA too much power in regulating emissions. The states that joined West Virginia were Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming.
In October 2021, four separate petitions (including two from coal corporations and one from North Dakota) were filed, asking the Court to review not only the D.C. Circuit's decision but the interpretation of what powers the EPA has been given by Congress through the Clean Air Act to apply to existing plants under § 7411(d). In the case of West Virginia's petition, there was concern that with the interpretation of § 7411(d) made by the D.C. Circuit court, the EPA "can set standards on a regional or even national level, forcing dramatic changes in how and where electricity is produced, as well as transforming any other sector of the economy where stationary sources emit greenhouse gases." In line with the findings from Michigan v. EPA, the petitioning parties expressed concern that under this interpretation of § 7411(d) "will impose costs we can never recoup because E.P.A., the state, and others will be forced to sink even more years and resources into an enterprise that is — at best — legally uncertain. The court should intervene now." 
The Biden administration urged the Supreme Court not to intervene, allowing the EPA to issue its new rule "taking into account all relevant considerations, including changes to the electricity sector that have occurred during the last several years", and allow time for it to be reviewed, rather than make judgment on a speculative EPA rule. The Supreme Court certified the four petitions on October 29, 2021, consolidating the cases under West Virginia v. EPA. Due to the Supreme Court granting the case for review, the EPA indicated it would wait until the Court's decision before proceeding with drafting any new rules to replace the CPP or ACE. 
On February 28, 2022, oral arguments were heard and the Court considered if aspects of the case fell within its major question doctrine, which the Supreme Court has used to require the judiciary to defer to Congress rather than executive agencies on matters with what it perceives to be significant impacts and outcomes if it believes Congress did not explicitly grant that power to the agency.
 Opinion of the Court 
On June 30, 2022, the Court's 6–3 decision was issued with Chief Justice John Roberts writing the majority opinion joined by the other conservative Justices. Roberts first rejected the EPA's argument that the case was moot since the CPP had been abandoned. Roberts said the case was still live "unless it is 'absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.'" Roberts further stated that since President Biden has stated on record his intent to "vigorously defend" the same approach as the CPP, that there was cause to review the CPP's rules. 
The Court ruled that the EPA does not have Congressional authority to limit emissions at existing power plants through generation shifting to cleaner sources (beyond the fence line), but still can regulate emissions at plants by emissions reductions technologies as they have done in the past. Finding that the proposed action of the CPP fell under its "major question doctrine", the Court decided that it required more specific Congressional approval to be implemented. Roberts wrote that "certain extraordinary cases, both separation of powers principles and a practical understanding of legislative intent make us 'reluctant to read into ambiguous statutory text' the delegation claimed to be lurking there... To convince us otherwise, something more than a merely plausible textual basis for the agency action is necessary. The agency instead must point to 'clear congressional authorization' for the power it claims."
Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion that was joined by Justice Samuel Alito. Gorsuch wrote of the importance of the major questions doctrine, stating that "seeks to protect against 'unintentional, oblique, or otherwise unlikely' intrusions" on the areas of "self-government, equality, fair notice, federalism, and the separation of powers".
Justice Elena Kagan wrote the dissent, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, citing concerns over climate change and the Court's involvement to override the expertise of the EPA. Kagan wrote: "The subject matter of the regulation here makes the Court’s intervention all the more troubling. Whatever else this Court may know about, it does not have a clue about how to address climate change. And let’s say the obvious: The stakes here are high. Yet the Court today prevents congressionally authorized agency action to curb power plants’ carbon dioxide emissions. The Court appoints itself—instead of Congress or the expert agency—the decision-maker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things more frightening. Respectfully, I dissent."
 Impact 
Some legal experts have stated that a ruling in West Virginia v. EPA which limits the EPA's power could have a significant impact on the agency's future ability to regulate emissions. In November 2021, Robert Percival, the director of the Environmental Law Program at the University of Maryland, said "This is likely to result in one of the most significant environmental rulings the court has ever reached." Further, because the Supreme Court did not wait until the EPA issued new rules, others felt this signaled that the Court was willing to review Congressional authorization and consider if such authorizations violated the nondelegation doctrine of separation of powers, which would further hamper the EPA's capabilities to regulate emissions. In November 2021, some legal analysts also believe that the Supreme Court's involvement is needed to resolve long-standing conflicts in § 7411(d) and other parts of the Clean Air Act.
The resulting decision did not go as far some experts speculated in removing the Chevron deference or strictly limiting the EPA's powers. However the decision did suggest that major rules made by the EPA or other agencies that go beyond direct interpretation of Congressional mandates may be scrutinized under the major questions doctrine. The rule also curbed further attempts to bring more clean energy sources through EPA regulations under the current CAA language.
The ruling also impacted Biden's climate change plan, which relied on cleaner power sources. While it did immediately set back the U.S.'s efforts to reduce greenhouse gases as much as had been planned, the EPA is still able to mandate emission reduction technology on older plants, such as carbon capture and carbon sequestration, and converting coal plants to operate off natural gas, which burns cleaner than coal. These improvements could reduce the carbon dioxide output from plants by 10% to 15%. However, as guided by Michigan v. EPA, costs must be included in the EPA's assessment, which may limit what technologies could be used. States themselves are also free to set emissions regulations, such as existing Global Warming Solutions Acts, though these regulations and laws are expected to become the subject of litigation.
Legal analyst Ian Millhiser questioned how the proposed CPP could have fallen under the Court's "major question doctrine" if the regulation would have had no effect, with the energy sector having met the CPP's targets more than a decade early even without it in place.
 Legislative action 
Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 in August following the West Virginia decision. Among other actions, the bill was written towards several of the points raised in the majority decision and possibly overturns it. The law's language addresses the major questions doctrine by explicitly granting EPA new authorities to regulate greenhouse gases. The law clarified that carbon dioxide from the combustion of fossil fuels is indeed one of several greenhouse gases to be treated as pollutants covered by the 1970 Clean Air Act, codifying Massachusetts. Some legal experts believe this would allow the EPA to set "outside the fence" regulations on existing power plants as to promote clean energy. Other analysts say the law does not extend the EPA's authority to alternative sources; Vermont Law School professor Patrick Parenteau said the Act does not include specific language towards generation shifting, leaving it as a potential major questions doctrine concern.

From "Westside Community Board of Education v. Mergens" ==> """
Westside Community Board of Education v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court case involving a school district's ability to hold classes on Bible study after school.
Background
Westside High School, in District 66, located in Omaha, Nebraska, refused to allow a group of students to form a Christian Bible Study Club within their school. Bridget Mergens is the name of the student who initiated the process to start the club. She was a senior at the time. It was decided that the club could not take place because they would not allow a staff member to sponsor it (staff sponsoring was required or the club meetings could not take place at the school). The students argued that the district's decision was in violation of the federal Equal Access Act requiring that groups seeking to express messages containing "religious, political, philosophical, or other content" not be denied the ability to form clubs.
Opinion  of the Court
In an 8–1 decision,. the Court held that denying equal access to the religious club violated the Equal Access Act, and that treating a religious club equally, including providing a sponsor like other clubs, would not constitute an endorsement of religion prohibited by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
The school's situation was placed under the Equal Access Act because it allowed other ‘limited open forums’. In Part III of Justice O'Connor's opinion, which did not reach a majority of the Court, she applied the Lemon Test to find that the Equal Access Act is constitutional as applied in this case. Justice Kennedy, meanwhile, analyzed the application of the Act under different Court precedents, focusing more upon "coercion".
Dissent
Justice Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, would have avoided the Establishment Clause issue.

From "Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co." ==> """
Weyerhaeuser Company v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Company, 549 U.S. 312 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case related to antitrust regulations.
 Background 
Both parties operated sawmills; Ross-Simmons was driven out of business by what it complained was Weyerhaeuser's attempted monopsonization of the market. The theory was "predatory buying": a purchaser buys so much of a given raw material that it drives up the price and thereby excludes less pecunious rivals who depend on the same raw material.
 Opinion of the Court 
The Supreme Court rejected the theory on a rule of reason analysis, noting that there are any number of legitimate business strategies that involve buying large quantities of raw materials. A plaintiff alleging predatory buying must therefore prove—and Ross-Simmons had not—that the defendant caused the price to rise, and that the defendant is likely to recoup the costs incurred in such a scheme. 
The Court's decision symmetrized its case law, with Weyerhaeuser and Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. applying identical standards to predatory buying and predatory selling claims respectively.

From "Weyerhaeuser Company v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service" ==> """
Weyerhaeuser Company v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service, 586 U.S. ___ (2018), was a United States Supreme Court case. It dealt with the designation of 1544 acres of private land in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana as "critical habitat" for the dusky gopher frog by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court vacated the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals decision that upheld the designation and sent the case back for further review.
Background
thumb|left|upright|The dusky gopher frog
The dusky gopher frog is critically endangered due to habitat loss, numbering 135 as of 2015; the frog needs ephemeral ponds for breeding, and is only found around one pond in De Soto National Forest, Mississippi. In 2012, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service  designated 1544 acres of land ("Unit 1") situated more than 50 miles from the pond in Mississippi where the frog resides as "critical habitat". The land, owned in part by timber company Weyerhaeuser and with the rest leased to them for harvesting timber, was last known to have the frogs in the 1960s. Under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, land that is not inhabited by a species but is "essential for the conservation of the species" can be classed as "critical habitat".
Unit 1 has five ephemeral ponds, which are of "remarkable quality" according to the Fish and Wildlife Service, but does not have open canopies, another required characteristic for it to be a habitat for the frogs. Weyerhaeuser argued that the land only has one of the required characteristics for being a habitat for the frog and that "Vast portions of the United States could be designated as critical habitat if a single feature used by an endangered species is present". The government, by contrast, said that it is feasible to transform Unit 1 into a habitat for the frogs and that there is no immediate impact of the designation, and cited multiple scientific studies to say that the land was vital for the conservation of the frog. It also argued that since the frog is only found in one area, transplanting the frog to other areas is necessary to prevent the extinction of the frog.
As the designation could cause $33 million in devaluation of the land over 20 years due to implications on possible future development, Weyerhaeuser challenged the decision. The Eastern District Court of Louisiana upheld the designation in 2013, and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed it 2-1 in 2016, holding that the Fish and Wildlife Service was not arbitrarily designating Unit 1 as "critical habitat", and that while under the Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service "may exclude any area from critical habitat if [it] determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat", a decision not to exclude based on economic impact was not subject to judicial review.
Supreme Court
The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in January 2018. Oral hearings occurred on October 1, 2018, prior to Justice Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Court.
The Court issued its unanimous decision on November 27, 2018, vacating the Appeals Court decision and sending the case back for further review. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the Court, instructed that the Court of Appeal must review the case in light of how the terms "habitat" and "critical habitat" are defined by the Endangered Species Act and the nature of how much degree of modification needs to be made to make a habitat a critical habitat, and to review the Service's decision not to exclude Area 1 from its cost and benefits analysis, as such decisions are eligible for judicial review.

From "Whalen v. Roe" ==> """
Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589 (1977), was a case brought before the Supreme Court of the United States..   The case involved a New York state prescription monitoring law requiring reporting and storage of information concerning all Schedule II drug prescriptions.  Physicians were required to report the name of the prescribing physician; the dispensing pharmacy; the drug and dosage; and the name, address, and age of the patient. This information was then stored by the New York Department of State.  
A group of patients, several doctors who prescribe such drugs, and two associations of physicians brought suit against the commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, seeking to enjoin the State from enforcing the Act.  
A three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, held the statutes unconstitutional and enjoined  enforcement of the challenged provisions. On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the district court, holding that the statutes were within the state's police power. The Supreme Court held that the state need not show the State action was necessary to solve the identified problem and that there was no basis for assuming that the state security provisions would be improperly administered.  The Court dismissed the plaintiff's key concerns, holding that the statutes would not significantly deter patients from seeking necessary medication nor would the statutes impair physicians' right to practice medicine free from unwarranted state interference.
 Background and prior history
In 1970, the New York Legislature created a special commission to evaluate the State's drug-control laws and their effectiveness in combating the illegal distribution and use of dangerous yet legal prescription drugs.   The commission found that the existing law was ineffective in preventing the use of stolen or revised prescriptions, in preventing pharmacists from refilling exhausted prescriptions, in preventing drug users from obtaining multiple physicians' prescriptions, or in preventing doctors from over-prescribing.
In 1972, the New York Legislature enacted a statutory scheme to address this problem.  These statutes required that physicians write all prescriptions on an official form.  This form included the physician’s name, the dispensing pharmacy, the drug and dosage; and the patient's name, address, and age.  A copy of the form was to be forwarded to the New York State Department of Health.  There the form would be recorded and the information would be stored for a period of five years.  Public disclosure of the information was strictly prohibited and the state had certain safeguards in place to secure the data.  
Challenging the constitutionality of these statutes, a group of patients and doctors brought a cause of action seeking to enjoin the state from enforcing the statutes.  The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York held for the plaintiffs, finding that the statutes invaded the constitutionally protected zone of privacy of the doctor-patient relationship.  The District Court enjoined the State from enforcing certain sections of the New York State Controlled Substance Act of 1972, to protect patient identity.  The District Court based its ruling on the theory that the State had failed to show a necessity for the patient identification requirement and without a necessity, the State action unconstitutionally invaded personal privacy.
Oral Arguments
The Court heard oral arguments for the case on October 13th, 1976.  Assistant Attorney General A. Seth Greenwald argued the case for the appellant, the State of New York.  Attorneys H. Miles Jaffe and  Michael Lesch argued for the appellees. 
 Majority opinion 
In 1977 the United States Supreme Court reversed the District Court's holding.  Justice Stevens wrote that the opinion of the Court held that State legislation is not unconstitutional merely because it is not found to be necessary.  Rejecting the District Court's analysis of Lochner v. New York,. Justice Stevens held that it is within the State's police power to enact legislation that attempts to deal with crime, such as the drug distribution problem in this case.   
Justice Stevens identified two different privacy interests which may be constitutionally protected: the interest of controlling the disclosure of personal matters and the interest of being able to make certain personal decisions free from government influence.  While Justice Stevens agreed with the Appellees that both of these interests may be affected by the statutes, Justice Stevens held that neither interest would be significantly impaired by the statutes.  Looking at the evidence before the court, Justice Stevens found that the increased risk of public disclosure was minimal compared to existing law and that patients’ decisions to receive these drugs would be largely unaffected by having to provide identifying information. 
Justice Stevens dismissed the group of doctors' arguments, stating that existing law already required doctors to prepare a written prescription with predominantly the same information.   Justice Stevens goes on to hold that any other concerns about patient decisions and the doctor patient relationship were covered in his discussion of patient privacy interests.
Finally, while acknowledging legitimate privacy concerns arising from government storage of citizens' personal information, Justice Stevens limited the holding to the specific facts in this case. He recognized that there might be valid constitutional issues should there be unwarranted disclosure of such private information, however this was not the case here.
Brennan's concurrence
While Justice Brennan agrees with the majority that the disclosure of patient information required by physicians pursuant to the New York statute to a limited number of public health officials has been historically prevalent and one not traditionally viewed as an invasion of privacy, he still expresses his concern with regards to the manner in which the statute mandates the information be stored-in a central computer. He concedes that simply because a new technology makes such information gathering more efficient, that alone cannot render the statute unconstitutional. However, in referring to the Fourth Amendment, he notes that there are constitutional limits to the kind of information that the State may collect and the manner in which it is collected.  
To Brennan, the development of computerized data and the ease with which computers can store large amounts of data poses an increased risk of misappropriation of such data. As such, Justice Brennan demonstrates his unwillingness to foreclose on the possibility that future circumstances might require similar limitations on technology in relation to privacy law as the Court has imposed on Fourth Amendment law. 
Nonetheless, Brennan points out that the New York statute had, based on the facts of the case before him, sufficiently protected the privacy interests of those patients in their information. Without an actual showing that the statute’s procedural safeguards have been ineffective in ensuring patients are not deprived of their privacy interests, the state could not be compelled to show that the collection of the data is absolutely necessary to control illegal drug use.
Stewart's concurrence
Justice Stewart points out that the Court noted in Katz v. United States that the Constitution does not provide individuals with any right to privacy. Rather, the constitution merely provides protection to individuals from government intrusion pursuant to the Fourth Amendment.  As a result, Justice Stewart takes exception to Justice Brennan's implication that had there been some dissemination of the information collected in accordance with the New York statute the state would have to show that the statute is necessary to achieving its compelling state interest-curtailing illegal drug use. Stewart qualified his concurrence by indicating he agreed with the majority's decision but that he agreed based on the assumption that the majority's was not contravening its precedent in Katz: the Constitution does not afford individuals any right to privacy.
Subsequent developments
Brennan's concurrence was prescient in some regards as increasingly advanced computer technology continues to develop while generating growing concerns about how private information is collected, particularly pertaining to health and medical records. These concerns were reflected by Congress when it passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996. The Act's overall objective was to provide national standards for electronic healthcare transactions, but the relevant part of the Act is Title II, which regulates how personal medical information can be used and disclosed by specifically outlined entities under the Act, such as healthcare providers.

From "Wharf (Holdings) Ltd. v. United International Holdings, Inc." ==> """
Wharf Holdings Ltd. v. United Int'l Holdings, Inc., 532 U.S. 588 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case decided in 2001. The case concerned a provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 dealing with manipulating and evading rules set by the SEC. The Court concluded that a secret understanding to violate an arrangement under the Act still constituted a violation, rejecting an argument that oral contracts were categorically excluded from the provision's coverage.
Background
In return for United International Holdings, Inc.'s assistance in preparing its application, contracts, system, and financing for a cable television system in Hong Kong, Wharf Holdings Ltd. orally granted United an option to buy 10% of stock in the system. The agreement was never written down. Ultimately, Wharf refused to allow United to exercise its option. United then sued Wharf in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, claiming that Wharf violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits using "any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance...in connection with the purchase or sale of any security."415 U.S.C. § 78j(b) Wharf's internal documents, which suggested that Wharf never intended to carry out its promise, supported United's claim. A jury found in United Holdings' favor, finding a violation of the 1934 Act. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.
Opinion of the Court
Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the unanimous decision of the Court, which affirmed the Tenth Circuit. The Court held that an oral agreement to give an option to buy stock while secretly intending never to honor that option violates the Securities Exchange Act of 1934's prohibition of deceptive devices. Justice Breyer wrote for the Court that there was no "convincing reason to interpret the Act to exclude oral contracts as a class. The Act itself says that it applies to 'any contract' for the purchase or sale of a security." Under this reasoning, the Tenth Circuit was correct in affirming the jury's verdict, and Wharf Limited was found to have violated the 1934 Act.

From "Wharton v. Wise" ==> """
Wharton v. Wise, 153 U.S. 155 (1894), is a 9-to-0 ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States, which denied a citizen of the state of Maryland a writ of habeas corpus. The appellant, tried and convicted of illegally harvesting oysters from Pocomoke Sound in the Chesapeake Bay, had argued that his right to fish was protected by an interstate compact and that this compact also barred the state of Virginia from trying him. The Supreme Court disagreed on both counts.. 
Background
The states and citizens of Maryland and Virginia had long disputed who had rights to fish in the mouth of the Pocomoke River (known as "Pocomoke Sound") where it emptied into Chesapeake Bay.Wennersten, The Oyster Wars of Chesapeake Bay, 2007, p. 47.Sansonetti and Quast, "Not Just a Western Issue Anymore: Water Disputes in the Eastern United States," Cumberland Law Review, 2003, p. 188-189. Maryland occupied the sound's northern side, while Virginia occupied its southern side. In 1785, the two states entered into a compact, which declared Pocomoke Sound, the Potomac River (which they also shared as a common border), and the Chesapeake Bay a common waterway, and each state pledged not to interfere with the other's water-borne traffic via tax, duty, prohibition, or restraint.Sansonetti and Quast, "Not Just a Western Issue Anymore: Water Disputes in the Eastern United States," Cumberland Law Review, 2003, p. 189.Wharton, 153 U.S. at 162-165. The seventh clause of the Maryland–Virginia Compact of 1785 provided that "the right of fishing in the [Potomac River] shall be common to and equally enjoyed by the citizens of both states, provided that such common right be not exercised by the citizens of the one state to the hindrance or disturbance of the fisheries on the shores of the other state, and that the citizens of neither state shall have a right to fish with nets or seines on the shores of the other."Wharton, 153 U.S. at 164. The eighth clause addressed both the Potomac and Pocomoke Rivers, and provided that all "laws and regulations which may be necessary for the preservation of fish, or for the performance of quarantine in the River Potowmack, or for preserving and keeping open the channel and navigation thereof, or of the River Pocomoke, within the limits of Virginia, by preventing the throwing out ballast or giving any other obstruction thereto, shall be made with the mutual consent and approbation of both states."Wharton, 153 U.S. at 164-165. Under the compact's tenth clause, crimes committed on these common waterways were to be tried thusly:  Virginians committing offenses against Marylanders should be tried in Maryland courts, Marylanders committing offenses against Virginians should be tried in Virginian courts, and citizens of neither state committing crimes against either Marylanders or Virginians should be tried in Virginian courts.Wharton, 153 U.S. at 165.
In 1892 Virginia passed a law barring all non-Virginians from harvesting oysters or any other shellfish from the Pocomoke River or Pocomoke Sound.
In March 1893, Robert Wharton, a citizen of Maryland, was arrested by Virginia law enforcement authorities for harvesting oysters from Pocomoke Sound.Wennersten, The Oyster Wars of Chesapeake Bay, 2007, p. 95.Sansonetti and Quast, "Not Just a Western Issue Anymore: Water Disputes in the Eastern United States," Cumberland Law Review, 2003, p. 189-190. Wharton argued at trial that the Compact of 1785 permitted him to fish without restriction in Pocomoke Sound, and that since the Virginia law had not been adopted by the state of Maryland there was no restriction on his activities. He also argued that, under the compact, Virginia had no right to try him. Virginia filed a demurrer, which the trial court sustained.  Wharton was convicted.  The defendant now filed a writ of habeas corpus against John H. Wise, Sheriff of the Accomack County, Virginia. The writ was heard by the United States district court for the eastern district of Virginia, which denied the writ.  The defendant appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Ruling
thumb|alt=The Fuller Court.|The Fuller Court.
Associate Justice Stephen Johnson Field wrote the majority opinion for the Court.
Justice Field briefly reviewed the background of the Compact of 1785, as well as the language of its relevant sections.
Virginia had questioned the validity of the Compact of 1785, suggesting it violated Article 6 of the Articles of Confederation (which banned treaties between states without the consent of the United States Congress) and was superseded at any rate by the U.S. Constitution (which entered into force in 1789).Wharton, 153 U.S. at 167. Field dismissed both claims. The Articles of Confederation prohibited pacts intended to weaken the Confederation, Field said, and did not ban all pacts between states. Although provisions of the compact could be superseded by the Constitution, none of the operative articles of it were; in fact, Maryland, Virginia, and the United States government have all treated the compact as if it were still binding and enforceable.Wharton, 153 U.S. at 167-168. Field relied heavily on Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U.S. 503 (1893), decided in the prior term, in defining what a "compact" was and the extent of the Constitution's prohibition on them.Wharton, 153 U.S. at 168-171. But Field not only concluded that the Compact of 1785 was not in violation of the Articles of Confederation but also strongly asserted that the Constitution did not apply to those already in force at the time of its adoption:Wharton, 153 U.S. at 171.
In our judgment, the Compact of 1785 was not prohibited by the Articles of Confederation. It was not a treaty, confederation, or alliance within the meaning of those terms as there used, and it remained as a subsisting operative contract between them, in full force, when the confederation went out of existence upon the adoption of the present Constitution of the United States, and it was not affected or set aside by the prohibitory clause of that instrument. Its prohibition extends only to future agreements or compacts, not against those already in existence, except so far as their stipulations might affect subjects placed under the control of Congress, such as commerce and the navigation of public waters, which is included under the power to regulate commerce. Furthermore, Field said, both states as recently as 1874 had agreed that the Compact of 1785 remained valid and in force.Wharton, 153 U.S. at 171-173.
Field now turned the Court's attention to the construction of the actual clauses contained in the compact. Field observed that Article 7 of the compact contained no reference to the Pocomoke, and so was irrelevant to the issue at hand.Wharton, 153 U.S. at 174. Article 8 likewise contained no relevant language, he said.Wharton, 153 U.S. at 174-175. Field rejected as wrongly decided Hendricks v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. 939, (1882), a decision by the Virginia Court of Appeals (which gave equal fishing rights in the Potomac and Pocomoke), because that court drew its conclusion based on a mis-quoted Article 8.Wharton, 153 U.S. at 175-176. Lastly, Field noted that at no time was Pocomoke Sound ever considered merely a part of the Pocomoke River.  The two bodies of water were, at the time the compact was entered into, and for many years thereafter, considered distinct bodies of water, and Pocomoke Sound was not covered by the Compact of 1785.Wharton, 153 U.S. at 176-177.
Finally, Field argued that the crime Wharton committed was a crime against the state of Virginia, not against one of her citizens. Since a crime against the state itself was not mentioned in the Compact of 1785, Virginia was entirely within her rights to try, convict, and punish Wharton.Wharton, 153 U.S. at 177.
The writ of habeas corpus was denied.

From "Wheaton v. Peters" ==> """
Wheaton v. Peters, 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 591 (1834), was the first United States Supreme Court ruling on copyright. The case upheld the power of Congress to make a grant of copyright protection subject to conditions and rejected the doctrine of a common law copyright in published works. The Court also declared that there could be no copyright in the Court's own judicial decisions..
Facts
The case arose out of the printing of the Supreme Court's own opinions. Henry Wheaton, the third reporter of decisions, had compiled the opinions of the Court, complete with annotations and summaries of the arguments in Court. This was useful material but made the volumes of his reports costly and out of the reach of most lawyers. His successor as reporter, Richard Peters, in addition to publishing the current volumes of reports, had gone over his predecessor's work, eliminating the arguments of counsel and other material beyond the opinions themselves, and published an abridged edition reducing twenty-four volumes into six. The Reporter's salary of $1,000 per year did not cover the full expenses of preparing the reports, and the Reporters relied on sales of their books to recoup their costs. By creating more affordable volumes, Peters devastated the market for Wheaton's more expensive ones.
Wheaton sued Peters in Pennsylvania and lost in the circuit court.Wheaton v. Peters, 29 F. Cas. 862 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1832) (No. 17,486). The judge, Joseph Hopkinson, ruled that copyright is purely the creation of statute and that one must comply with the formal requirements for copyright, such as registering the copyright and placing a copyright notice in the work, in order to receive protection. Judge Hopkinson also ruled that there was no federal common law, that one must look to the states for common law and, even then, that the states did not necessarily adopt the entire English common law — assuming there was a common law copyright.
Wheaton appealed to the Supreme Court.
Result
Justice John McLean, who himself had publishing experience as the founder of an Ohio newspaper, wrote the opinion of the Court. The Court ruled that while the common law protected copyright in unpublished writings (such as diaries or personal letters), "this is a very different right from that which asserts a perpetual and exclusive property in the future publication of the work, after the author shall have published it to the world."33 U.S. at 658. McLean declared that post-publication copyright did not exist in the United States, but only as a function of statute. "Congress, then, by this act, instead of sanctioning an existing right, as contended, created it."33 U.S. at 660–61. McLean also rejected Wheaton's contention that requiring registration and the deposit of a copy of the copyrighted work with the Department of State were improper prerequisites to copyright protection. Because Congress was granting authors the protection of copyright, it could require them to observe the statutory formalities. This precedent corresponded to the English decision in Donaldson v Beckett, which was cited in the Court's opinion.
The Court remanded the case to the circuit court to determine whether Wheaton had satisfied the requirements for copyright protection. Finally, in an often-quoted sentence, the opinion concluded: "It may be proper to remark that the Court is unanimously of opinion that no reporter has or can have any copyright in the written opinions delivered by this Court, and that the judges thereof cannot confer on any reporter any such right."33 U.S. at 668. Thus, any copyright protection for published judicial opinions could cover ancillary materials such as summaries of the opinions and commentaries on them, but not the judicially authored texts of the opinions themselves.
Dissents
Justice Smith Thompson wrote a dissenting opinion, in which he concluded that Wheaton was entitled to an injunction against Peters' publication of his reports.
Justice Henry Baldwin also dissented, but his reasoning was not recorded in the original opinion. It appeared in a revised edition of the U.S. Reports, published posthumously in 1884.
Later developments
Case resolution
As the Supreme Court had directed, the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania held a trial on the issue of whether Wheaton had satisfied the copyright formalities. The court ruled that he had. Peters appealed, but while the second appeal was pending, both Wheaton and Peters died. The case was then settled, with Peters' estate paying Wheaton's estate $400.
Legal history
Wheaton v. Peters was the first in a line of cases in which the Supreme Court has traditionally tried to prevent people from being able to monopolize information using copyright law, especially text of the laws that govern everyone. The decision was upheld and expanded to all judicial opinions in Banks v. Manchester, although Callaghan v. Myers established that editorial additions to the materials could be restricted by copyright.

From "Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander" ==> """
Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, 337 U.S. 562 (1949), was a United States Supreme Court case in which two out-of-state corporations objected to ad valorem taxes imposed upon accounts receivable derived from goods manufactured in Ohio, though these accounts were not used in conducting business in Ohio. The court ruled that the tax violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
Background
Wheeling Steel Corp., incorporated in Delaware was authorized to do business in Ohio, and maintained four of its eight manufacturing plants in Ohio. Wheeling's general offices were/are in Wheeling, West Virginia and had sales offices in twelve other states, including Ohio. All accounts were billed and collected from the corporation's main office in Wheeling, West Virginia.
National Distillers Products Corporation was incorporated in Virginia and maintained its principal place of business in New York. National Distillers was admitted to do business in Ohio and maintained both a distillery and a warehouse in Ohio, as well as maintaining distilleries and warehouses in six other states. National Distillers operated its payroll through the local offices and conducted all other fiscal affairs from its office in New York. National Distillers did not maintain a sales office in Ohio; orders from Ohio were forwarded to the office in New York for approval.
Both appellants paid all taxes required to do business in Ohio, all taxes on real and personal property in Ohio, and all franchise taxes. Additionally, Wheeling paid ad valorem taxes to West Virginia on all accounts receivable, including on those accounts receivable taxed by Ohio, pursuant to Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Fox, 298 US 193. National Distillers' accounts receivable were taxed by neither Virginia nor New York.
The Ohio Tax Commissioner assessed ad valorem taxes on accounts receivable derived from shipments originating from Ohio manufacturing plants belonging to Wheeling Steel Corporation and National Distillers Products Corporation on the grounds that such accounts "result from the sale of property from a stock of goods maintained within the state.". The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed both assessments.
Both appellants appealed the Tax Board's decision. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed the tax in both cases,150 Ohio St. 229, 80 N.E.2d 863 which were then brought before the Supreme Court of the United States.
Opinion of the Court
The court held that the ad valorem tax assessed against the accounts receivable of these corporations violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The court declined to address the issue of whether Ohio violated the Due Process Clause in assessing this tax. The court pointed out that Ohio was not required to admit these foreign corporations to do business within Ohio, and could have limited the terms that these corporations could conduct business within Ohio, so long as any limits did not violate rights derived from the Constitution. Instead, Ohio chose to admit these corporations to conduct business in Ohio, a privilege that these corporations paid taxes to secure and maintain. Because Ohio chose to domesticate these foreign corporations, these corporations became entitled to equal protection with all other domestic corporations established under Ohio law. Ohio's ad valorem tax impermissibly discriminates between domestic and foreign corporations, denying appellants equal protection under Ohio law.
Dissent
Mr. Justice Douglas is troubled by the notion that corporations are to be classified as people for the purpose of interpreting the Equal Protection Clause. The dissent points out that other clauses in the Constitution that refer to people or persons do not apply to corporations. To read that a reference to persons in the Equal Protection Clause includes corporations as persons is inconsistent and should not be presumed.

From "White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker" ==> """
White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136 (1980), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States holding that Arizona's taxes that were assessed against a non-Indian contractor that was working exclusively for an Indian tribe on that tribe's reservation were preempted by federal law..
Background
thumb|350px|left|alt=Map showing the White Mountain Apache Reservation|Map showing the Fort Apache Indian Reservation (in red - upper half)
History
The Fort Apache Timber Company (FATCO) is a tribal enterprise created by the White Mountain Apache tribe contracted with the Pinetop Logging Company (Pinetop) in 1969 to transport and sell lumber harvested by FATCO on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation.  The lumber itself is harvested from land held in trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for the benefit of the tribe.  The BIA has a contract with FATCO to harvest the trees, but the BIA controlled which trees would be taken, the equipment to be used, where and what roads would be used and logging truck speeds.  Pinetop vehicles do not leave the reservation, and only used roads built and maintained by BIA.  In 1971, the Arizona Highway Department (now the Arizona Department of Transportation) sought to collect a motor carrier tax and a fuel tax from Pinetop.  Pinetop paid under protest, and both Pinetop and the tribe sued to recover the taxes.
Lower courts
The Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, granted a summary judgment to the state and both the tribe and Pinetop appealed. At the Arizona Court of Appeals, Pinetop argued that McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n. prohibited the taxes that Arizona sought. The state argued that Pinetop was not part of the tribe and were not owned by Indians, and therefore the tax applied. The appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court.  Both the tribe and Pinetop appealed, but the Arizona Supreme Court declined to review the decision. The United States Supreme Court then granted certiorari to hear the case.
Opinion of the Court
Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion of the court. Marshall held that when a state seeks to assert authority over activities on a reservation by a non-Indian, that the court must look at the nature of the state, federal and tribal interests that are at stake. Here, the federal government, through the BIA, extensively regulated and controlled the timber operation and are so pervasive as to preclude any state taxation of the non-Indian contractor. The decision of the Arizona Court of Appeals was reversed.
Concurrence
Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., concurred with the majority. The fact that the roads that Pinetop used were BIA or tribal roads would mean that the state was taxing for revenue that would not be needed to maintain the roads being used, and that this amounted to double taxation.
Dissent
Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justices Potter Stewart and William Rehnquist, dissented. Stevens believed that the state could tax Pinetop, and that it was not relevant as to whether those taxes were passed on to the tribe. He would have affirmed the decision.

From "White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v. Apollo Co." ==> """
White-Smith Music Publishing Company v. Apollo Company, 209 U.S. 1 (1908), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which ruled that manufacturers of music rolls for player pianos did not have to pay royalties to the composers. The ruling was based on a holding that the piano rolls were not copies of the plaintiffs' copyrighted sheet music, but were instead parts of the machine that reproduced the music.
This case was subsequently eclipsed by Congress's intervention in the form of an amendment to the Copyright Act of 1909, introducing a compulsory license for the manufacture and distribution of such "mechanical" embodiments of musical works.  
Issue and relevance
The main issue was whether or not something had to be directly perceptible (meaning intelligible to an ordinary human being) for it to be a "copy."  Naturally, hardly anyone could perceive (read) music by looking at a roll of paper with holes in it.  The 1976 Copyright Act later clarified the issue, defining a "copy" as a "material object . . . in which a work is fixed . . . and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device."  This case remains relevant because the 1976 Copyright Act makes an "otherwise inexplicable distinction between 'copies' and 'phonorecords.'"
Perhaps the greatest relevance of White-Smith, however, is that it foreshadowed the debate over whether object code (computer program code in the form of 0s and 1s encoded in a magnetic tape or disc or in an EPROM) was protected by US copyright law. In the early 1980s the issue was in considerable doubt, and initially several lower court decisions held that object code was not a "copy" of a computer program.See, e.g., Data Cash Sys., Inc. v. JS&A Group, Inc., 480 F. Supp. 1063 (N.D. Ill. 1979), aff'd on other grounds, 628 F.2d 1038 (7th Cir. 1980) (suggesting that ROMmed object code is not a “writing"). Two court of appeals decisions involving copying of Apple computers and their software were influential in reversing the tide. Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp., 714 F.2d 1240 (3d Cir. 1983), cert. dism'd by stip., 464 U.S. 1033 (1984), and Apple Computer, Inc., v. Formula International, Inc., 725 F.2d 521 (9th Cir. 1984). They upheld the protectability of object code embodiments of computer programs and rejected the supposed requirement that a candidate for status as a work of authorship must communicate a message to human readers or perceivers. These decisions wrote the human-intelligibility requirement of White-Smith out of copyright law, as a qualification for investiture of copyright, although the "piano-roll amendment" had only established that human-intelligibility was not a requirement for an infringing "copy." In principle, what infringes could be broader than what gives rise to copyright, on the theory that works of authorship need a hedge or moat around them to assure adequate protection. But that does not appear to be the law.
The White-Smith case also appears to be the source of a legal metaphor used in US patent law relating to computer programs. As explained in greater detail in the Wikipedia article Piano Roll Blues, the legal fiction developed in US patent law that placing a new program in an old general-purpose digital computer creates a new computer and thus a "new machine" for purposes of section 10135 U.S.C. sec. 101. of the US patent statute (listing patent-eligible subject matter). Critics of this argument derisively termed it the "Old Piano Roll Blues," meaning that the argument was equivalent to asserting that placing a new piano roll into an old player piano transformed it into a new player piano. The 2014 decision of the United States Supreme Court in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International appears to have extinguished the Piano roll blues argument by holding that simply saying “apply it with a computer” will not transform a patent-ineligible claim to an idea into a patent-eligible claim.Alice, slip opinion. at  10 (“We conclude that the method claims, which merely require generic computer implementation, fail to transform that abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.”), 13 (“These cases demonstrate that the mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.”).

From "Whitfield v. United States" ==> """
Whitfield v. United States, 574 U.S. 265 (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case that concerned whether the forced accompaniment statute under  applies when a bank, credit union, or savings/loan association robber, or attempted robber, forces someone to accompany them for any distance. Defense attorney Joshua B. Carpenter argued on behalf of the Petitioner, and Assistant to the Solicitor General Brian H. Fletcher argued on behalf of the Department of Justice.
Background
On September 26, 2008, Larry Whitfield and Quanterrious McCoy attempted to rob a  branch of the Fort Financial Credit Union in Gastonia, North Carolina, but were foiled when a metal detector at the entrance went off. The two would-be robbers fled the scene, first by a getaway vehicle that crashed, then by foot. The two ditched their weapons in a wooded area before McCoy hid under a nearby van and Whitfield broke into the home of Mary Parnell, a 79-year-old grandmother with a history of heart disease and high blood pressure. Whitfield tried to assure Parnell he did not intend to hurt her, but asked her to come with him to another area of the house - a room where they could not be seen by the police. When Whitfield tried to call a friend for a new getaway vehicle, Parnell panicked, had a heart attack, and died.
Whitfield was indicted on multiple counts related to the attempted robbery, including under section 2113(e) for forcing Parnell to "accompany" him from one part of her house to another. At his trial, the jury instructions mentioned that "the term 'forced accompaniment' includes... forcing a person to move from one part of a building to another against her will" and "does not require ... that the defendant crossed a property line, moved a person a particular number of feet, held a person for a particular period of time, or placed the person at a certain level of danger." Whitfield pleaded "not guilty" to force accompaniment but a jury convicted him for the offense. Because the crime had a "resulting in death" specification, Whitfield received a mandatory life sentence, albeit this specification was later removed and his sentence was reduced to 27 years.
On appeal, Whitfield's legal team argued the word "accompany" pursuant to section 2113(e) requires a "substantial" amount of forced movement, and because Whitfield had only forced Parnell to accompany him from one room to another (a distance of less than 10 feet) the evidence in this case did not qualify. The Fourth Circuit heard the appeal but affirmed the initial judgement on the offense. In writing for the Court, Judge King stated, "[a]lthough Whitfield required Mrs. Parnell to accompany him for only a short distance within her own home, and for a brief period, no more is required to prove that a forced accompaniment occurred."
Opinion
In a 9–0 decision, Justice Scalia delivered the unanimous opinion on January 13, 2015. In writing for the Court, Scalia argued the word "accompany" has always described any movement in which one "goes with" another over any distance - not just circumstances that could be described as kidnapping - and he specifically cited David Copperfield where Uriah "accompanied me into Mr. Wickfield's room" and Pride and Prejudice where Elizabeth "accompanied her out of the room." Scalia further noted that while bank robbers may always assert some level of control over others, forced accompaniment (such as using a hostage as human shield or forcing a bank employee to walk with the robber to the vault) is distinct from other movement control (such as forcing hostages to lay on the ground or demanding a bank teller to put their hands behind their head), and the danger to the victim posed by forced accompaniment does not vary depending on the distance traversed. He concluded: 
 Aftermath 
Whitfield is currently serving his sentence at Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Dix, and is scheduled for release on November 23, 2031.

From "Whitman v. American Trucking Ass'ns, Inc." ==> """
Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc., 531 U.S. 457 (2001), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court in which the Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for regulating ozone and particulate matter was challenged by the American Trucking Association, along with other private companies and the states of Michigan, Ohio, and West Virginia..
The Supreme Court faced the issues of whether the statute had impermissibly delegated legislative power to the agency and whether the Administrator of the EPA, Christine Todd Whitman, could consider the costs of implementation in setting national ambient air quality standards.Whitman, 531 U.S. at 462.
Background
Section 109(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act instructed the EPA to set "ambient air quality standards the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the Administrator, based on [the] criteria [documents of Section 108] and allowing an adequate margin of safety, are requisite to protect the public health." The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals had decided that the standard making procedure delegated by Congress to the EPA to set air quality was an unconstitutional delegation in contravention of Article I, Section I, of the US Constitution because the EPA had interpreted the statute to provide "no intelligible principle" to guide the agency's exercise of authority. It also found that the EPA could not consider the economic cost of implementing a national ambient air quality standard.
Decision
In an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part the Court of Appeals' decision.Whitman, 531 U.S. at 486. The Court affirmed that the text of Section 109(b) unambiguously barred cost considerations from the NAAQS-setting process. The Court wrote, "Whether the statute delegates legislative power is a question for the courts, and an agency’s voluntary self-denial has no bearing upon the answer.”Whitman, 531 U.S. at 473. The Court determined that the scope of discretion that Section 109(b)(1) allowed was well within the outer limits of nondelegation precedents.Whitman, 531 U.S. at 474. The Court concluded this based on prior holdings, noting it had only twice found an intelligible principle lacking in a statutory delegation: one which contained "literally no guidance for the exercise of discretion," and
the other "conferred authority to regulate the entire economy on the basis of no more precise a standard than stimulating the economy by assuring 'fair competition.'" Consequently, the Court remanded the case for the Court of Appeals to reinterpret the statute that would avoid a delegation of legislative power.Whitman, 531 U.S. at 476. 
Concurrences
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurrence. He was not sure that the intelligible principle criterion served to prevent all cessions of legislative power.Whitman, 531 U.S. at 487 (Thomas., concurring). He believed that there are cases in which the principle itself is intelligible but the significance of the delegated decision is simply too great for the decision to be called anything other than legislative. He stated that he would be willing to reconsider the delegation precedents in the future to determine whether delegation jurisprudence has strayed too far from Founders' understanding of separation of powers. The Court also held that EPA’s implementation policy constituted a final agency action subject to judicial review and that two statutory provisions for ozone, Subpart I and Subpart 2, were seemingly in conflict and EPA must reconcile these provisions on remand.
Justice John Paul Stevens also wrote a separate concurrence, which was joined by Justice Souter.Whitman, 531 U.S. at 487-490 (Stevens, J., concurring). They both agreed with the Court that Section 109(b)(1) did grant the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to promulgate national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) but they wanted to acknowledge that the power delegated to the EPA was "legislative power" which the majority does not agree with. They support this claim by defining how to properly characterize governmental power which should depend on the nature of the power not on the identity of the person using the power.

From "Whitmore v. Arkansas" ==> """
Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149 (1990), is a U.S. Supreme Court Case that held that the Eighth and the Fourteenth Amendments do not require mandatory appellate review of death penalty cases and that individuals cannot file cases as a next friend unless there is a prior relationship to the appellant and unless the appellant is "unable to litigate his own cause due to mental incapacity, lack of access to court, or other similar disability".
Background
Ronald Gene Simmons was convicted of the mass murder of sixteen people and sentenced to death. Arkansas state law did not require appellate review of capital sentences, and Simmons chose to contest neither the conviction nor the sentence, in fact, requesting a speedy execution:
I, Ronald Gene Simmons, Sr., want it to be known that it is my wish and my desire that absolutely no action by anybody be taken to appeal or in any way change this sentence. It is further respectfully requested that this sentence be carried out expeditiously.
Arkansas state law allowed the waiving of capital appeals so long as a separate hearing determined the competence of the condemned man. With Simmons' competence verified, his execution was to proceed when a fellow death row inmate, Jonas Whitmore, filed suit against the state of Arkansas both for himself and on behalf of Simmons.
Whitmore had been sent to Arkansas' death row in 1989 for stabbing to death a 62-year-old woman and robbing her of $250 after she had let him into her home and fed him milk and cookies. Whitmore had exhausted his direct line of appeals within the state and was about to pursue a habeas corpus claim in federal court. Whitmore wanted to see Simmons' case appealed within Arkansas because he believed that if his plea in the federal courts was successful and he was granted a new trial in which he was convicted anew, during sentencing, his single murder would look far less bad than Simmons' massacre of sixteen. Whitmore's attempt to force Simmons's case into appeal was three-pronged, arguing that:
He suffered injury by Simmons' lack of appeal and therefore the absence of Simmons' murder being considered during comparative review.
Lack of appellate review violated the Constitution's protections against cruel and unusual punishment and due process.
Whitmore also filed as next friend to Simmons, trying to force, in Simmons' name, the appeal that Simmons himself refused.
Petition by Louis Franz
Prior to Whitmore seeking appeal of Simmons' sentence, Louis J. Franz filed an appeal for Simmons as his next friend. Franz was a Catholic priest who ministered to prisoners in Arkansas and was also a member of Arkansas Churches for Life, an anti-death penalty organization. The Arkansas Supreme Court granted a stay of Simmons' execution while they considered Franz's petition. The Arkansas courts ultimately rejected Franz's petition due to the fact that Franz had not established that he had previously met Simmons, let alone had a close relationship to him. Franz also claimed standing as an aggrieved taxpayer and a concerned citizen. Both of those claims were also rejected.
Petition by Whitmore
In 1989, the Arkansas Supreme Court, citing Franz's petition, rejected Whitmore's motion to intervene in Simmons' case.
On March 15, 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of execution for Whitmore to give time for it to consider his case.
On March 30, 1989, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued a stay of execution.
Opinion of the Court
The Court ruled against Whitmore on April 24, 1990, with Chief Justice Rehnquist writing for the majority of seven. 
Whitmore's "hypothetical" claim of injury was rejected as Whitmore could not prove that Simmons' appeal would change the outcome of a future sentencing review for Whitmore. Furthermore, that mandatory appellate review of Simmons' case was not a right "granted to [Whitmore] personally."
While Simmons had the right to appellate review, it did not violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on "cruel and unusual punishment" for Simmons to not be forced to request appellate review, and thus Whitmore had no cause for action as an interested member of the public.
Lastly, Whitmore was ineligible to file suit as next friend because Simmons, as an evidentiary hearing had shown, "[had] given a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to proceed, and his access to court [was] otherwise unimpeded." Next friend was designed for cases where the real party in interest is "unable to litigate his own cause due to mental incapacity, lack of access to court, or other similar disability".
Dissent
Justice Marshall wrote a dissent that was joined by Justice Brennan. Justice Marshall concluded that: 
While appellate review is, as previously decided, not required in non-capital cases, "the unique, irrevocable nature of the death penalty necessitates safeguards not required for other punishments," as "[t]he core concern of all our death penalty decisions is that States take steps to ensure to the greatest extent possible that no person is wrongfully executed. A person is just as wrongfully executed when he is innocent of the crime or was improperly convicted as when he was erroneously sentenced to death. States therefore must provide review of both the convictions and sentences in death cases."
Whitmore, as a citizen, has standing because appellate review "protect[s] society's fundamental interest in ensuring that the coercive power of the State is not employed in a manner that shocks the community's conscience or undermines the integrity of our criminal justice system."
Simmons is unable to waive appellate review as a defendant cannot make a "voluntary submission to a barbaric punishment," just as "a defendant's consent to being drawn and quartered or burned at the stake would not license the State to exact such punishments."
Aftermath
Ronald Gene Simmons was executed by lethal injection on June 25, 1990.
Jonas Whitmore was executed on May 11, 1994.
Whitmore was cited in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld to deny both Christian Peregrim, a private citizen, and Frank Dunham, a public defender for the Eastern District of Virginia, next of friend standing to request habeas relief for Yaser Hamdi, an American-born resident of Kuwait who was captured in Afghanistan.

From "Whitney v. California" ==> """
Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357 (1927), was a United States Supreme Court decision upholding the conviction of an individual who had engaged in speech that raised a threat to society. Whitney was explicitly overruled by Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1969.
Background
Charlotte Anita Whitney, a member of a distinguished California family, was convicted under the 1919 California Criminal Syndicalism Act for allegedly helping to establish the Communist Labor Party of America, a group charged by the state with teaching the violent overthrow of government.
Whitney denied that it had been the intention of her or other organizers for the party to become an instrument of violence.
Decision
The question before the court was whether the 1919 Criminal Syndicalism Act of California violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The Court unanimously upheld Whitney's conviction. Justice Sanford wrote for the seven-justice majority opinion and invoked the Holmes test of "clear and present danger" but also went further.
The Court held that the state, in exercise of its police power, has the power to punish those who abuse their rights to freedom of speech "by utterances inimical to the public welfare, tending to incite crime, disturb the public peace, or endanger the foundations of organized government and threaten its overthrow." In other words, words with a "bad tendency" can be punished.
Brandeis's concurrence 
The case is most noted for Justice Louis Brandeis's concurrence, which many scholars have lauded as perhaps the greatest defense of freedom of speech ever written by a member of the high court. Justices Brandeis and Holmes concurred because of the Fourteenth Amendment questions, but there is no question the sentiments are a distinct dissent from the views of the prevailing majority and supported the First Amendment.
Holmes, in Abrams, had been willing to defend speech on abstract grounds: that unpopular ideas should have their opportunity to compete in the "marketplace of ideas." Brandeis, however, had a much more specific reason for defending speech, and the power of his opinion derives from the connection he made between free speech and the democratic process.
He held citizens have an obligation to take part in the governing process, and they cannot do so unless they can discuss and criticize governmental policy fully and without fear. If the government can punish unpopular views, it cramps freedom, and in the long run, that will strangle democratic processes. Thus, free speech is not only an abstract virtue but also a key element at the heart of a democratic society.
Implicitly, Brandeis here moves far beyond the "clear and present danger" test, and insists on what some have called a "time to answer" test: no danger flowing from speech can be considered "clear and present" if there is full opportunity for discussion. While upholding full and free speech, Brandeis tells legislatures, while they have a right to curb truly dangerous expression, they must define clearly the nature of that danger. Mere fear of unpopular ideas will not do:274 US 376 (1927)
Subsequent jurisprudence and further developments
Justice William O. Douglas believed that had Brandeis lived longer, he would have abandoned the clear and present danger test; Whitney is in fact the precursor to the position Douglas and Hugo L. Black took in the 1950s and 1960s, that freedom of speech is absolutely protected under the First Amendment. Brandeis does not go that far here, and his views were ultimately adopted by the Court in Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), in which the U.S. Supreme Court explicitly overruled Whitney.
Whitney was later pardoned by the Governor of California based on Justice Brandeis' concurring opinion.

Commentary
Philippa Strum, former director of the Division of United States Studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, has asserted that Whitney was a pacifist who believed in working within the American political system. According to Strum, the evidence presented at the trial focused on the platform and actions of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a radical organization to which Whitney had contributed a small amount of money, but of which she was not a member. Whitney was, in effect, put on trial for her association with the IWW as well as her own reform activities, which included fighting for gender and racial equality and advocating a more equitable political and economic system.Philippa Strum, Speaking Freely: Whitney v. California and American Speech Law, University Press of Kansas (2015).

From "Whitus v. Georgia" ==> """
Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U.S. 545 (1967), found in favor of the petitioner (Whitus), who had been convicted for murder, and as such reversed their convictions.. This was due to the Georgia jury selection policies, in which it was alleged racial discrimination had occurred.
The plaintiffs argued that, as their county had a 45% population of African-Americans, it was discrimination and unfair to have been presented with all-white or nearly all-white juries each time. Thus, the Supreme Court – as well as overturning the convictions – ruled that Georgia renew its jury selection policies. Previous law meant tax returns would be sorted, and "Negroes" would have a '(c)' placed next to their name. In the conviction of Whitus, the jury had been selected via old lists.
 Background 
After petitioners, who are black, were convicted of murder in the Georgia courts, they filed a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts, attacking the composition of the grand and petit juries which indicted and convicted them. The District Court dismissed the writ and the Court of Appeals affirmed. This Court vacated that judgment and remanded to the District Court for a hearing on the claim of discrimination ( 370 U.S. 728 ).
 Decision 
 Majority opinion 
The majority opinion of the Court was delivered by Justice Tom C. Clark. Justice Clark states that the appeal is not whether the defendants were wrongfully convicted of murder but if the jury selection purposely excluded the admittance of African Americans from the grand and petit juries. The system of selecting jurors comes from the books of the county tax receiver but questions have been raised about if the system is rigged with notations that signify which males on the tax receiver's list are African American. The court granted certiorari and found the circumstances surrounding the state were sufficient to support the claims of racial discrimination.
 Decision 
On January 23, 1967, in a nine to zero unanimous decision, the Supreme Court stated that the case of Whitus v. Georgia should be reversed and the law in question, being the 14th Amendment concerning equal protections, should be upheld and seen as constitutional. From the opinion of Justice Clark, the decision was overturned because the circumstances surrounding the case supported the claims of the petitioners. The claims were claims of discrimination which the Court had realized and therefore reversed the judgement. The Court of Appeals held that African Americans were purposely being excluded from the grand juries and the petit juries. The ruling to reverse the judgment and prove discrimination was based on the finding that 45% of the population was African American yet no African American had ever actually served on a jury.
 Influence 
The Whitus case influenced court decisions in the future. In McCleskey v. Kemp, petitioner, a black man, was convicted in a Georgia trial court of armed robbery and murder, arising from the killing of a white police officer during the robbery of a store. Pursuant to Georgia statutes, the jury at the penalty hearing considered the mitigating and aggravating circumstances of petitioner's conduct, and recommended the death penalty on the murder charge. The trial court followed the recommendation, and the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed. After unsuccessfully seeking postconviction relief in state courts, petitioner sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court. His petition included a claim that the Georgia capital sentencing process was administered in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. In support of the claim, petitioner proffered a statistical study (the Baldus study) that purports to show a disparity in the imposition of the death sentence in Georgia based on the murder victim's race and, to a lesser extent, the defendant's race. The study is based on over 2,000 murder cases that occurred in Georgia during the 1970s, and involves data relating to the victim's race, the defendant's race, and the various combinations of such persons' races. The study indicates that black defendants who killed white victims have the greatest likelihood of receiving the death penalty. Rejecting petitioner's constitutional claims, the court denied his petition insofar as it was based on the Baldus study, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's decision on this issue. It assumed the validity of the Baldus study, but found the statistics insufficient to demonstrate unconstitutional discrimination in the Fourteenth Amendment context or to show irrationality, arbitrariness, and capriciousness under Eighth Amendment analysis. Our analysis begins with the basic principle that a defendant who alleges an equal protection violation has the burden of proving "the existence of purposeful discrimination." Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U.S. 545, 550 (1967).

From "Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt" ==> """
Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U.S. 582 (2016), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court decided on June 27, 2016. The Court ruled 5–3 that Texas cannot place restrictions on the delivery of abortion services that create an undue burden for women seeking an abortion. On June 28, 2016, the Supreme Court refused to hear challenges from Wisconsin and Mississippi where federal appeals courts had struck down similar laws. Other states with similar laws may also be impacted.
 Background 
In 2013, Texas passed a law, H.B. 2, placing a series of restrictions on abortion clinics within the state. In November 2013, one of H.B. 2's requirements that abortion providers have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles took effect. In the time since the admitting privileges requirement took effect, the number of abortion clinics in Texas declined from 42 to 19.
The law also required abortion providers to meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers and to upgrade their building, safety, parking, and staffing to meet the standards of a hospital room. Whole Woman's Health, however, has deemed these requirements unnecessary and expensive as well as an attempt to limit abortion access rather than provide safety to women. This part of the law was enforced in Texas in the beginning of October 2014, but its enforcement was suspended pending the outcome of this case. Texas had waived some or all of the surgical-center requirements for 336 of the 433 (78%) licensed ambulatory surgical centers in Texas,Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , slip. op. at 12 but had not waived any part of the surgical-center requirements for any of the abortion clinics in the state.Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , slip. op. at 5
First lawsuit
A group of plaintiffs including Whole Woman's Health sued, bringing a facial challenge to the admitting-privileges provision. On October 28, 2013, the day before the law was to take effect, Judge Earl Leroy Yeakel III of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas in Austin, Texas granted the plaintiffs an injunction invalidating the provision.Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 951 F.Supp2d 891 (W.D. Tex. 2013).
Three days later, a motions panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit made of Circuit Judges Priscilla Richman, Jennifer Walker Elrod, and Catharina Haynes, granted an emergency stay of the injunction, allowing the law to go into effect.Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 734 F. 3d 406 (5th Cir. 2013).  On November 19, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to vacate the stay, with Justice Scalia, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito, writing a concurrence and Justice Breyer, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan, writing a dissent.Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. v. Abbott, 134 S. Ct. 506, 571 U.S., 187 L. Ed. 2d 465 (2013).  On March 27, 2014, Circuit Judge Edith Jones, joined by Judges Elrod and Haynes, upheld the challenged provision.Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 748 F. 3d 583 (5th Cir. 2014).  Whole Woman's Health did not petition the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari.
Second lawsuit
On April 6, 2014, Whole Woman's Health filled a new lawsuit, now seeking to block the admitting-privileges provision as applied to the Whole Woman's Health in McAllen, Texas and the Nova Health Systems in El Paso, Texas, as well as to block the surgical centre provision throughout Texas.  The court held a four-day bench trial and on August 29, 2014, Judge Yeakel issued a state-wide injunction barring enforcement of both provisions.Whole Woman's Health v. Lakey, 46 F. Supp. 3d 673 (W.D. Tex. 2014).
On October 2, 2014, Circuit Judge Elrod, joined by Judge Jerry Edwin Smith and with Stephen A. Higginson dissenting in part, stayed the lower court's injunction pending appeal.Whole Woman's Health v. Lakey, 769 F. 3d 285 (5th Cir. 2014).  On October 14, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the Fifth Circuit, reimposing the injunction blocking the law, over a dissent by Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito.Whole Woman's Health v. Lakey, 135 S. Ct. 399, 574 U.S., 190 L. Ed. 2d 247 (2014).  On June 9, 2015, Circuit Judges Edward C. Prado, Elrod, and Haynes, in an anonymous per curiam decision, found on the merits that the two provisions were constitutional.Whole Women's Health v. Cole, 790 F. 3d 563 (per curiam), modified, 790 F. 3d 598 (5th Cir. 2015).
The Fifth Circuit reversed the court order protecting the El Paso clinic but upheld the order protecting the McAllen clinic. The three-judge panel upheld the majority of the Texas law.Whole Woman's Health v. Cole, No. 14-50928, slip. op. at 56 (5th Cir. 2015) (per curiam). The panel held that the law was constitutional under Planned Parenthood v. Casey'''s undue burden standard because the law "does not place a substantial obstacle in path of those women seeking an abortion".Whole Woman's Health v. Cole, slip. op. at 55 (5th Cir. 2015).
 Supreme Court 
Before H.B. 2 could take effect, the petitioners requested a stay from the Supreme Court. On June 29, 2015, the court granted a temporary stay by a 5–4 vote, and it later granted an indefinite stay. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito would have denied the stay. On November 13, 2015, the court granted a writ of certiorari to review the Fifth Circuit's holding. Over eighty amicus curiae briefs were filed with the Court,   including one signed by prominent female lawyers stating that they had each had an abortion and the decision had paved the way for their legal careers.  Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, Br. Am. Curiae of Janice Macavoy et al., filed Jan. 4, 2016 ("“To the world, I am an attorney who had an abortion, and, to myself, I am an attorney because I had an abortion.”)  A competing brief in support of the Texas law was filed on behalf of women who said they suffered psychological or physical harm due to their abortions.  On February 13, 2016, Justice Scalia died, leaving eight justices to hear the case. Ninety minutes of oral arguments were heard on March 2, 2016, with Scott A. Keller, the Solicitor General of Texas, appearing for the state, Stephanie Toti of the Center for Reproductive Rights appearing for Whole Woman's Health, and Donald B. Verrilli Jr., the Solicitor General of the United States, appearing as a friend of the court in support of the clinic.
During the questioning phase of the oral arguments, the liberal side of the court, including Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan, questioned the true intention of the law and Texas's justification for it. Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller argued that women living far from Texas abortion clinics––due to the closure of many abortion clinics struggling to comply with the requirement's standards––were not unduly burdened in gaining access to abortions because they could access clinics in New Mexico, a state with more lenient standards. In response, Justice Ginsburg noted: "So if your argument is right, then New Mexico is not an available way out for Texas, because Texas says: To protect our women, we need these things. But send them off to New Mexico... and that's perfectly all right."
Opinion of the Court
thumb|right|200px|Justice Stephen Breyer was the author of the Court's opinion.
On June 27, 2016, the Court ruled by a 5–3 vote that Texas cannot place restrictions on the delivery of abortion services that create an undue burden for women seeking an abortion, and therefore the sections of Texas law H.B. 2 challenged here are invalid. In an opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer, the court struck down key provisions of the law––those requiring doctors who perform abortions to have difficult-to-obtain "admitting privileges" at a local hospital and requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities––as violating a woman's right to an abortion. Observing that these provisions do not offer medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes, the majority concluded: "Each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a pre-viability abortion, each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access, and each violates the federal Constitution." The majority opinion struck down both provisions "facially", that is, the very words of the provisions are invalid, irrespective of how they might be implemented or applied. According to the ruling, the task of judging whether a law puts an unconstitutional burden on a woman's right to abortion rests with the courts and not the legislatures.
Justice Breyer wrote, "We have found nothing in Texas’ record evidence that shows that, compared to prior law (which required a “working arrangement” with a doctor with admitting privileges), the new law advanced Texas’ legitimate interest in protecting women's health." He noted that, when asked at oral argument whether Texas knew of a single instance in which the new requirement would have helped even one woman obtain better treatment, Texas admitted that there was no evidence in the record of such a case.Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , slip. op. at 23 He found that, if H.B. 2 were allowed to take full effect, the number of Texan women living more than 200 miles from the nearest abortion clinic would increase from 10,000 to 750,000.Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , slip. op. at 6
Justice Breyer dismissed the state's claim that the Pennsylvania case of Kermit Gosnell justified additional regulation: "Gosnell's behavior was terribly wrong. But there is no reason to believe that an extra layer of regulation would have affected that behavior. Determined wrongdoers, already ignoring existing statutes and safety measures, are unlikely to be convinced to adopt safe practices by a new overlay of regulations. Regardless, Gosnell's deplorable crimes could escape detection only because his facility went un-inspected for more than 15 years. Pre-existing Texas law already contained numerous detailed regulations covering abortion facilities, including a requirement that facilities be inspected at least annually."Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , slip. op. at 27
Concurrence
In a two-page concurrence, Justice Ginsburg wrote, "Many medical procedures, including childbirth, are far more dangerous to patients, yet are not subject to ambulatory surgical-center or hospital admitting-privileges requirements. ... Given those realities, it is beyond rational belief that H. B. 2 could genuinely protect the health of women, and certain that the law 'would simply make it more difficult for them to obtain abortions.' ... When a State severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners. ... [L]aws like H. B. 2 that 'do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments to abortion' cannot survive judicial inspection."
Dissents
Justice Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, stating that the majority "reimagines the undue-burden standard" for abortion access, creating a "benefits-and-burdens balancing test" that courts should have instead deferred to the legislatures to resolve. Justice Alito, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, filed a second dissenting opinion, arguing that there is no direct causal link between the Texas law and the closings of abortion clinics, and they may have also been affected by the withdrawal of state funds, declining demand for abortions, and retirements of doctors. Alito also stated that Texas might well have been motivated to protect women by the Kermit Gosnell case in Pennsylvania, in which a doctor had been convicted on three charges of murder and one of manslaughter.
Subsequent developments
Reception
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised the decision as a victory for women, saying "By striking down politically motivated restrictions that made it nearly impossible for Texans to exercise their full reproductive rights, the Court upheld every woman’s right to safe, legal abortion, no matter where she lives." President Obama issued a statement applauding the Court's decision and reiterating his commitment to "women's health, including protecting a woman's access to safe, affordable health care and her right to determine her own future." Senator Bernie Sanders applauded the decision, calling it a "decisive victory for women across the country."
Senator Ted Cruz expressed disappointment with the ruling, saying "the Supreme Court sided with abortion extremists who care more about providing abortion-on-demand than they do protecting women’s health." He also vowed to fight for "unborn life."
A statement issued on behalf of the Catholic Church bishops in Texas said the decision "puts women at grave risk" because "Surgical abortion is an invasive procedure that poses numerous and serious medical complications.  The state has a legitimate interest in ensuring the maximum level of safety for the woman subjected to the procedure and that viable emergency care is available if complications such as hemorrhage, infection, uterine perforation, blood clots, cervical tears, or allergic reactions occur. It is irresponsible for physicians to perform this procedure without being able to provide follow-up treatment for the associated complications."
The decision may impact similar restrictions on abortion access in other states. Steve Vladeck, a professor of law at American University Washington College of Law, stated:   Vladeck also added that 
Other cases
At the time of the decision, five states required abortion clinics to operate under "hospital-like" standards: Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Tennessee, though in the last of these  a court order prevented enforcement. Nine states required doctors to have hospital admitting privileges, of which three were enforcing that requirement (North Dakota, Missouri, and Tennessee) and six were not (Wisconsin, Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama).
A few hours after the Supreme Court announced its ruling, Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange announced he would drop his appeal of a U.S. District Court ruling that had invalidated the state's hospital admitting privileges requirement for abortion providers. On June 28, 2016, the Supreme Court declined appeals in related cases from Wisconsin and Mississippi. It let stand a ruling that the state of Washington can require pharmacists to fill prescriptions for contraceptives to which they have religious objections. Justice Alito, in a dissent joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, wrote: "If this is a sign of how religious liberty claims will be treated in the years ahead, those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern." The court also rejected appeals by Mississippi and Wisconsin that sought to require abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges.
Louisiana had passed Act 620 in 2014, modeled after Texas' law that would require doctors to have admission privileges at a hospital within 30 miles, effectively reducing the number of legal clinics to one at the time of passage. The law was challenged by abortion clinics and doctors in June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo, and while the District Court ordered an injunction to prevent the law going into effect, the Fifth Circuit reversed the injunction. The plaintiffs obtained an emergency stay of the Fifth Circuit's decision from the Supreme Court while Whole Woman's Health was under litigation. Following this case's decision, the Louisiana law was declared unconstitutional by the District Court on rehearing on the basis of Whole Woman's Health, but the Fifth Circuit again reversed the decision. Plaintiffs have again sought an emergency stay order from the Supreme Court. On February 7, 2019, the United States Supreme Court granted a stay and temporarily enjoined the state of Louisiana from enforcing the law while the plaintiffs appeal the decision of the Fifth Circuit. The Supreme Court ruled on June 29, 2020 that the Louisiana law was similarly unconstitutional, with Roberts as the deciding vote. Roberts maintained his position of dissent in the opinion of the court but upheld the judgement of unconstitutionality as found in Whole Woman's Health as a matter of past court precedent.

From "Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson" ==> """
Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson, 595 U.S. ___ (2021), was a United States Supreme Court case brought by Texas abortion providers and abortion rights advocates that challenged the constitutionality of the Texas Heartbeat Act, a law that outlaws abortions after six weeks. The Texas Heartbeat Act prohibits state officials from enforcing the ban but authorizes private individuals to enforce the law by suing anyone who performs, aids, or abets an abortion after six weeks. The law was structured this way to evade pre-enforcement judicial review because lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of state statutes are typically brought against state officials who are charged with enforcing the law, as the state itself cannot be sued under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.
The case centered on whether a state can insulate its laws from pre-enforcement judicial review in this manner by authorizing private individuals to enforce the law while forbidding public enforcement by state officials. On December 10, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that abortion providers could not sue state-court judges, court clerks, or the state's Attorney General in an effort to stop the filing of private civil-enforcement lawsuits. The Court also held that the abortion providers' claims against state licensing officials could proceed past the motion-to-dismiss stage.
 Background 
The Texas Heartbeat Act, also referred to as Senate Bill 8 or SB 8 for short, is a law enacted by the Republican majorities in the 87th Texas Legislature during its regular session that prohibits abortion, including in cases of rape and incest, 6 weeks into a woman's pregnancy.
The Texas law is novel and unique in that it prohibits public enforcement by state actors and instead creates an exclusive mechanism of civil enforcement by private individuals. This was motivated by a desire to avoid ordinary constitutional challenges to restrictive state abortion laws against state officials in federal court. The law was written in a manner to insulate state officials from being the target of lawsuits challenging its constitutionality under the Ex parte Young exception to the sovereign immunity of states in federal court.
 Previous litigation 
Shortly before the law took effect on September 1, with the state defendants' appeal pending in the Fifth Circuit, the plaintiffs sought emergency relief in the Supreme Court of the United States in the form of an injunction pending appeal. The Supreme Court denied the request, and issued a collection of dissenting statements by individual members along with its order, which shed light on the divergent views on the court.
Although the majority denied instant relief, and thus allowed the Texas Heartbeat Act to go into effect, the court was careful to note that they were not rendering an opinion on the constitutionality of SB 8, and that such challenges could proceed in lower courts, including state courts. Legal challenges to WWH v. Jackson, along with the federal government's case against the state in United States v. Texas, continued, and on October 22, 2021, the Supreme Court again denied instant relief, but fast-tracked both to be heard on November 1, 2021.
Concurrent litigation
 State court litigation 
The Texas law underlying this case has been heavily criticized, as it is believed to violate the constitutional right to privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment, established by the landmark Supreme Court decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In Roe, the Supreme Court held that states may not regulate abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy. In Casey, the Court established the undue burden test. The removal of state officials as enforcement agents in SB 8 is seen as a means to work around Roe v. Wade, and if upheld, would allow other states to take similar approaches to regulate abortions within the first trimester. Organizations like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood stood ready to challenge the law in court. On September 4, 2021, a Texas state judge granted an ex parte temporary restraining order shielding clinics from SB 8 lawsuits by Texas Right to Life for fourteen days. This was followed by an Agreed Temporary Injunction on September 13, 2021.
More than a dozen lawsuits brought by abortion providers and advocates are pending in state district courts in Travis County, Texas. Trial court proceedings were put on hold for some time by the Texas Multi-District Litigation Panel on motion by Defendant Texas Right to Life, pending a decision on whether to consolidate these cases. The cases were subsequently assigned to a retired judge and a hearing on motions for summary judgment and cross-motions to dismiss was held on November 10, 2021.
 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization 
Prior to the bill's enactment, the Supreme Court had granted review in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a case over a Mississippi abortion law blocking abortions after the fifteenth week, which is set to be heard in December 2021. Following the Supreme Court's refusal to block Texas's law, numerous friends-of-the-court briefs were submitted to support the position of abortion clinics in Dobbs. Texas Right to Life likewise weighed in with an amicus brief by Jonathan Mitchell.
 United States v. Texas 
The Biden Administration via the Department of Justice filed suit in the name of the United States against Texas, which was transferred to the same federal district judge in Austin, Texas, who presides over WWH v. Jackson. A three-hour hearing by video conference on the DOJ's application for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Texas Heartbeat Act by state and private actors took place on October 1, 2021. Judge Pitman did not immediately issue a ruling, however. The case is United States v. State of Texas, Civil Action No. 1:21-cv-00796-RP, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas.
On October 6, 2021, Judge Pitman granted the DOJ's application for a preliminary injunction stopping the state judiciary from accepting, hearing, and adjudicating SB8 claims, and requiring notices to be posted on court websites, which Texas immediately appealed. On October 8, 2021, a panel of the Fifth Circuit granted the State's emergency motion for an administrative stay of Judge Pitman's preliminary injunction order.
The federal government petitioned the Supreme Court again to place a preliminary injunction on enforcement of the law. On October 22, 2021, the Supreme Court refused to grant the stay, but agreed to fast track both United States v. Texas and WWH v. Jackson for oral arguments on November 1, 2021. The Supreme Court in the government's case will review the government's standing. On the same day of issuing its decision for WWH, the Supreme Court dismissed the case as improvidently granted.
 First phase 
 Lower courts 
Following the law's enactment in May 2021, several abortion clinics and their proponents filed a preemptive federal lawsuit in the Western District of Texas to block enforcement of the law prior to its September 1, 2021, enforcement date. The plaintiffs named Texas' attorney general Ken Paxton, a Texas state district court judge (Austin Reeve Jackson) and his court clerk, various Texas state officials involved in medical licensing that had a role in SB 8's enforcement, and one private individual as defendants, following public statements from the private individual of their intent to seek a civil suit under the new law once it came into effect. In their suit, the plaintiffs argued that state judges, clerks, and other officials were not exempt from becoming defendants due to the Ex Parte Young doctrine, an exception to sovereign immunity when state officials have "some connection with the enforcement of the act". The abortion groups sought injunctive relief against all respondents, as well as against all state judges and clerks, to enjoin private enforcement actions under SB 8. The state judge and other state defendants responded by asserting their sovereign immunity defined in SB 8. District judge Robert Pitman denied the respondents' request to dismiss on August 25, 2021, stating that the state officials were subject to Ex parte Young exemptions, since the judges and clerks were central to enforcement of SB 8.
The state respondents brought their immediate appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit issued an order on August 27, 2021, putting on hold all further proceedings in the district court, including a scheduled hearing on the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction, pending resolution of the immunity issues. The Fifth Circuit ruled in part of a standing principle in that Circuit from Bauer v. Texas (2003) which decided that "The requirement of a justiciable controversy is not satisfied where a judge acts in his adjudicatory capacity", thus exempting several of the state officials from the Ex parte Young issues. The defendants' immunity would deprive federal courts of jurisdiction and would prevent them from determining the merits of the constitutional arguments.
 Supreme Court 
On August 30, 2021, the Center for Reproductive Rights filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court of the United States, seeking to block the Act from going into effect. The Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson dispute did not reach the Supreme Court in the regular manner after an adverse decision on the merits by a circuit court of appeals. Instead, the plaintiffs sought emergency relief directly from the Supreme Court that the Fifth Circuit would not provide on an expedited basis. In the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs' application was accorded shadow docket treatment, meaning that there was no full briefing on the merits and no oral argument.
The Supreme Court denied the motion to an emergency application via order on September 1, 2021, nearly 24 hours after the Act had come into force. The unsigned statement denying the motion stressed that it did not preclude other legal challenges in lower federal or Texas state courts. Four members of the court, Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's more liberal members, Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor, all wrote or joined dissents. In her dissent, Justice Sotomayor wrote that "presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand". The Supreme Court's procedural order and accompanying rationale in this case did not directly overrule the court's landmark Roe v. Wade precedent, but has been viewed as a threat to it. In its order disposing of the application for extraordinary relief, the court explicitly avoided deciding whether the Texas law was constitutional or not, leaving that question open for further litigation. The court also expressed doubts whether the novel issues raised by the Texas Heartbeat Act could be litigated in a federal action against state officials.
 Second phase 
 Fifth Circuit 
A motions panel of the Fifth Circuit ruled on September 10, 2021, subsequently rejecting the proposition that Texas state judges and their clerks are proper defendants in an action under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act or under the Ex Parte Young exception to sovereign immunity. The panel ruled that the state officials listed in the defendants lack any "enforcement connection" to SB 8. Separately, the Fifth Circuit panel also ruled in favor of the private individual, maintaining a stay of proceedings of the case within the district court while they expedited the case for further review.
 Supreme Court 
The plaintiffs petitioned the Supreme Court again to place a preliminary injunction on enforcement of the law. On October 22, 2021, the Supreme Court refused to grant the stay, but agreed to fast track WWH v. Jackson for oral arguments on November 1, 2021, alongside those of United States v. Texas. The Court will review the constitutionality of the law within the scope of WWH v. Jackson, specifically on whether the law insulates state officials from being defendants of lawsuits. Oral arguments related to WWH v. Jackson focused on the chilling effect the law has had since no abortions had taken place in the state since the Act came into enforcement, and without any legal action under the Act, there would be no way to provide federal review of the law. Further, the Justices considered if the Texas bill could be used as a template for other states to design laws to allow public restriction of other rights like gun control or free speech.
The Court issued its decision on December 10, 2021, which reversed parts of the Circuit Court's decision while upholding others, and remanding the case to the Fifth Circuit. The Court was split on which defendants should be kept or removed from Whole Woman's Health lawsuit, with multiple partial concurrences and partial dissents in addition to the majority opinion from Justice Neil Gorsuch. Gorsuch wrote "The Court granted certiorari before judgment in this case to determine whether, under our precedents, certain abortion providers can pursue a pre-enforcement challenge to a recently enacted Texas statute. We conclude that such an action is permissible against some of the named defendants but not others." The decision did not make any statement on the constitutionality of SB8, allowing the law to remain in enforcement.
The Court decided 8–1 to allow the lawsuits to continue against those state officials involved in the medical licensing as they had an active role in enforcing SB 8. Justice Clarence Thomas was the sole dissent to this part of the decision, believing that not even the medical licensing staff should be subject to the lawsuit, stating "S. B. 8's supporters are under greater threat of litigation than its detractors."
The Court was split 5–4 in dismissing Paxton and state judicial system clerks from the Whole Woman's Health lawsuit. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the partial dissent to this part of the decision, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Roberts believed the suits against state officials should continue, stating "'The clear purpose and actual effect of S. B. 8 has been to nullify this Court's rulings. It is, however, a basic principle that the Constitution is the 'fundamental and paramount law of the nation,' and '[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.' [Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803)]. Indeed, '[i]f the legislatures of the several states may, at will, annul the judgments of the courts of the United States, and destroy the rights acquired under those judgments, the constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery.' [United States v. Peters, 5 Cranch 115, 136 (1809)]. The nature of the federal right infringed does not matter; it is the role of the Supreme Court in our constitutional system that is at stake."
The Court was unanimous in dismissing the lawsuit against the private individual who had threatened to sue under SB8, as during litigation, this individual had testified they no longer had any intent to file suit.
Justice Sotomayor wrote a dissent in part, joined by justices Breyer and Kagan, arguing that the Court should have rendered SB8 unconstitutional as it provides a "model for nullifying federal rights" for other states. She wrote "The Court should have put an end to this madness months ago, before S. B. 8 first went into effect. It failed to do so then, and it fails again today." She concluded "By foreclosing suit against state-court officials and the state attorney general, the Court effectively invites other States to refine S. B. 8's model for nullifying federal rights. The Court thus betrays not only the citizens of Texas, but also our constitutional system of government."
 Third Phase 
The plaintiffs requested on December 13 that the Court’s formal mandate be issued immediately, rather than waiting the default 25 days, and that it be issued directly to the District Court (to Judge Pitman, who had previously ruled for the plaintiffs).Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson (2021) (Docket No. 21-463) (Application to Issue the Judgment Forthwith). The remaining state defendants requested that the mandate instead issue after the normal period and to the Fifth Circuit (where the panel had ruled for the defendants, and where they could seek to certify an issue in the case to the Texas Supreme Court).Id. (Response to Application From Respondents Stephen Carlton, et al.). On December 16, Justice Gorsuch granted the plaintiffs’ request for an expedited mandate but issued the mandate to the Fifth Circuit as requested by the defendants.
Justice Gorsuch’s opinion had stated that “it appears Texas law imposes on the licensing-official defendants a duty to enforce a law that ‘regulate[s] or prohibit[s] abortion,’ a duty expressly preserved by S. B. 8’s saving clause. Of course, Texas courts and not this one are the final arbiters of the meaning of state statutory directions.” On this point, Gorsuch was writing for a four-justice plurality (as Thomas did not join part II-C), but the four justices in the Roberts concurrence/dissent also agreed that those officials had enforcement authority.
On remand, the Fifth Circuit (by a 2–1 vote) on January 17 certified to the Supreme Court of Texas the state-law question of whether any of the state defendants had enforcement authority regarding SB 8, second-guessing the 8–1 conclusion of the U.S. Supreme Court that the Texas Medical Board at least “appears” to have enforcement authority.Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson, 23 F.4th 380 (5th Cir. 2022).
Before this order, the plaintiffs sought a writ of mandamus on January 3 from the U.S. Supreme Court to order the Fifth Circuit to instead remand the case to the District Court. On January 22, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition in In re Whole Woman’s Health,  595 U.S. ___ (2022), over dissents by Breyer (joined by Sotomayor and Kagan) and Sotomayor (joined by Breyer and Kagan).In re Whole Woman’s Health,  595 U.S. ___ (2022) (Docket No. 21-962) (On Petition for Writ of Mandamus).
On certification, the Supreme Court of Texas unanimously held on March 11 that none of the state defendants has authority to enforce the statute, agreeing with Justice Thomas’s lone opinion and rejecting the contrary reading (an Erie guess) of the other 8 justices as an erroneous interpretation of Texas law.Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson, 642 S.W.3d 569 (Tex. 2022) Accordingly, on April 26 the Fifth Circuit remanded the case and ordered all remaining government defendants to be dismissed for lack of enforcement authority,Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson, 31 F.4th 1004 (5th Cir. 2022) (Per Curiam). effectively ending the case without a ruling blocking SB 8.
Two months later, on June 24, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, overruling Roe v. Wade (1973). As such, SB 8’s approximately six-week ban on abortions was superseded by other Texas abortion bans starting from conception. SB 8’s $10,000 civil penalties have never been enforced against anyone, but the possibility of SB 8 lawsuits deterred most abortions in Texas even before Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey were overruled.

From "Whorton v. Bockting" ==> """
Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. 406 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case about the application of the Confrontation Clause and whether Crawford v. Washington (2006) applied retroactively. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for a unanimous Court, ruled that Crawford did not apply retroactively.
 Background 
The respondent, Marvin Howard Bockting, of Las Vegas, Nevada, was accused of sexual assault of his wife Laura's six-year-old daughter.  A police detective interviewed the victim in the presence of her mother, and physical evidence was gathered at a hospital.  The grand jury indicted Bockting on four counts of sexual assault on a minor under 14 years of age.  The victim testified at the preliminary hearing, and Bockting was held over for trial. 
At trial, the court held a hearing to determine whether the victim could testify. Finding that Autumn was too distressed to be sworn in, the State moved to allow Laura Bockting and the detective to recount the victim's statements to the jury.  Under Nevada law, out-of-court statements made by a child under 10 years of age describing acts of sexual assault or physical abuse of the child may be admitted if the court finds that the child is unavailable or unable to testify and that "the time, content and circumstances of the statement provide sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness."Nev. Rev. Stat. §51.385 (2003) The court found sufficient evidence of reliability to admit the testimony.
After hearing the evidence, the jury found Bockting guilty of three counts of sexual assault on a minor under the age of 14, and the court imposed two consecutive life sentences and another concurrent life sentence.
 Procedural history 
Bockting appealed to the Nevada Supreme Court, alleging that by allowing the out-of-court statements to be read to the jury, the state had violated Bockting's confrontation clause rights under the Sixth Amendment.  That Court held that the admission of the testimony was constitutional.Bockting v. State, 109 Nev. 103, 847 P. 2d 1364 (1993)
Bockting then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, making the same argument.  The Court denied the petition, stating that Bockting was not entitled to relief under the habeas statute.  Bockting appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  While the appeal to the Ninth Circuit was pending, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Crawford v. Washington, in which the Court held that testimony of witnesses absent from trial are admissible only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness.   The Ninth Circuit held that Crawford applied retroactively, and reversed the lower court decision.Bockting v. Bayer, 399 F. 3d 1010, as amended, 408 F. 3d 1127 (2005).  The State appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.
 Decision 
 Issue 
Did the holding in Crawford apply retroactively to judgments in criminal cases that are already final on direct review?
 Opinion of the Court 
Justice Samuel Alito gave the unanimous opinion of the Court.  "Because Crawford announced a new rule and because it is clear and undisputed that the rule is procedural and not substantive, that rule cannot be applied in this collateral attack on respondent’s conviction unless it is a watershed rul[e] of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding."Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. ___ (2006)(internal quotes omitted)  There are two requirements for a holding to be a "watershed rule"  First, the new rule must be "necessary to prevent an impermissibly large risk of an inaccurate conviction."  Second, it must "alter our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding."
The Court found that the holding in Crawford did not meet the first requirement, as it was too limited in scope.  It also did not meet the second requirement, in that it only slightly changed the cross-examination jurisprudence, but did not fundamentally alter it.  Therefore, the Court held, it was not a "watershed rule" and did not apply retroactively to Bockting's case.

From "Whren v. United States" ==> """
Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806 (1996), was a unanimous United States Supreme Court decision that "declared that any traffic offense committed by a driver was a legitimate legal basis for a stop."
In an opinion authored by Antonin Scalia, the court held that a search and seizure is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment in cases where the police officers have a "reasonable suspicion" that a traffic violation has occurred. The personal, or subjective, motives of an officer are not a factor in the Court's Fourth Amendment analysis of whether the cause for a stop is sufficient. The standard for reasonable suspicion is purely an objective one.. 
A main concern with this case is that police conducting traffic stops may profile based on race.  It also interprets the Fourth Amendment. Both petitioners believe that the traffic stop did not warrant a search of their vehicle and their arrest. Similar to the complaints and outrage about New York City's Stop and Frisk program, some believe that the ruling in Whren v. United States will lead to an increase in racial profiling towards young African American males.
 Background 
On June 10, 1993, Michael Whren and James L. Brown were driving around Washington D.C. in an SUV. Brown was the driver, and Whren sat in the passenger seat. They were driving in what was considered a "high drug area."
Meanwhile, two officers dressed in plainclothes were patrolling the area in an unmarked car. They were members of the District of Columbia's Vice Squad and were assigned to the area; they noticed the suspicious vehicle pulled over at a stop sign for about 20 seconds. The passenger was distracting the driver. As the officers approached the vehicle, the vehicle turned at an "unreasonable" speed without using their turning signal. For the traffic violation, the officers pulled over Whren and Brown.
Upon approaching the car, the officer noticed two plastic bags of crack cocaine in Whren's hands. Marijuana laced with PCP was also found in plain sight. The two were charged with possession with the intent to distribute around 50 g of crack cocaine. Also, Whren and Brown were pulled over in a school zone, which resulted in harsher federal drug violation sentences.
 Lower courts 
Before trial, counsel for the defense moved to suppress the drug evidence by claiming that the traffic stop was only a pretext to investigate possible drug crimes, without probable cause. In other words, the officers used common traffic violations only to investigate other criminal activity to make an arrest. They tried to form the argument that this arrest was a breach of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.http://www.sdflaw.com/files/The_Law_of_Pretext_Stops_Since_Whren_v_United_States.pdf 
The motion to suppress was denied by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and both defendants were sentenced to 14 years. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the previous ruling.
 Question 
"In this case we decide whether the temporary detention of a motorist who the police have probable cause to believe has committed a civil traffic violation is inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures unless a reasonable officer would have been motivated to stop the car by a desire to enforce the traffic laws." In other words, did the officers breach the Fourth Amendment with an illegal search and seizure?
 Decision 
The court came to a unanimous decision, written by Justice Scalia:The temporary detention of a motorist upon probable cause to believe that he has violated the traffic laws does not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures, even if a reasonable officer would not have stopped the motorist absent some additional law enforcement objective.
If  officers have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation occurred, they are allowed to stop a vehicle. Because the petitioners sped away at an "unreasonable" speed, the officers were given reasonable cause to stop the vehicle. A traffic violation occurred, which made the following search and seizure lawful. The officers did not ignore the danger of a pretextual stop but acted on a crime.
The court also rejected the petitioners claim that the government's interest in traffic safety led to anxiety, confusion, and haste for Whren and Brown. There was nothing particularly harmful about the search and seizure.
Scalia noted previous cases involving police stops. Using Delaware v. Prouse (1979) and other cases, Scalia claimed that because there was a traffic violation, the search and seizure did not violate constitutional rights: "such stops could be made regardless of an officer's true intentions."
The Court agreed that race has no place in enforcement by pointing to the Equal Protection Clause. It claimed that as long as there was some probable cause of a traffic violation, the officer has the right to pull over a vehicle.
 Racial profiling 
A major racial issue in this case is the concern surrounding pretext stops. David Harris argues that pretextual traffic stops are "deepening distrust and cynicism by African Americans about police and the entire criminal Justice System."

From "Wickard v. Filburn" ==> """
Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942), is a United States Supreme Court decision that dramatically increased the regulatory power of the federal government. It remains as one of the most important and far-reaching cases concerning the New Deal, and it set a precedent for an expansive reading of the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause for decades to come. The goal of the legal challenge was to end the entire federal crop support program by declaring it unconstitutional.
An Ohio farmer, Roscoe Filburn, was growing wheat to feed animals on his own farm. The U.S. government had established limits on wheat production, based on the acreage owned by a farmer, to stabilize wheat prices and supplies. Filburn grew more than was permitted and so was ordered to pay a penalty. In response, he said that because his wheat was not sold, it could not be regulated as commerce, let alone "interstate" commerce (described in the Constitution as "Commerce... among the several states"). The Supreme Court disagreed: "Whether the subject of the regulation in question was 'production', 'consumption', or 'marketing' is, therefore, not material for purposes of deciding the question of federal power before us.... But even if appellee's activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce and this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined as 'direct' or 'indirect.'".
The Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution's Commerce Clause, in Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution, which permits the U.S. Congress "to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes." The Court decided that Filburn's wheat-growing activities reduced the amount of wheat he would buy for animal feed on the open market, which is traded nationally, is thus interstate, and is therefore within the scope of the Commerce Clause. Although Filburn's relatively small amount of production of more wheat than he was allotted would not affect interstate commerce itself, the cumulative actions of thousands of other farmers like Filburn would become substantial. Therefore the Court decided that the federal government could regulate Filburn's production.
 Background 
The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 limited the area that farmers could devote to wheat production. Its stated purpose was to stabilize the price of wheat in the national market by controlling the amount of wheat produced. It was motivated by a belief by Congress that great international fluctuations in the supply and the demand for wheat were leading to wide swings in the price of wheat, which were deemed to be harmful to the U.S. agricultural economy.
The Supreme Court's decision states that the parties had stipulated as to the economic conditions leading to passage of the legislation:
Roscoe Filburn was a farmer in what is now suburban Dayton, Ohio. He admitted producing wheat in excess of the amount permitted. He maintained, however, that the excess wheat was produced for his private consumption on his own farm. Since it never entered commerce at all, much less interstate commerce, he argued that it was not a proper subject of federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.
In July 1940, pursuant to the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) of 1938, Filburn's 1941 allotment was established at  and a normal yield of 20.1 bushels of wheat per acre (). Filburn was given notice of the allotment in July 1940, before the fall planting of his 1941 crop of wheat, and again in July 1941, before it was harvested. Despite the notices, Filburn planted  and harvested 239 more bushels () than was allowed from his  of excess area. 
The Federal District Court ruled in favor of Filburn. The Act required an affirmative vote of farmers by plebiscite to implement the quota. Much of the District Court decision related to the way in which the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture had campaigned for passage: the District Court had held that the Secretary's comments were improper. The government then appealed to the Supreme Court, which called the District Court's holding (against the campaign methods that led to passage of the quota by farmers) a "manifest error." The Court then went on to uphold the Act under the Interstate Commerce Clause.
By the time that the case reached the high court, eight out of the nine justices had been appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt, the architect of the New Deal legislation. In addition, the case was heard during wartime, shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor galvanized the United States to enter the Second World War."In times of war, this Court has deferred to a considerable extent—and properly so—to the military and to the Executive Branch."; Nos. 03-334, 03-343, SHAFIQ RASUL v. GEORGE W. BUSH, FAWZI KHALID ABDULLAH FAHAD AL ODAH v. UNITED STATES, On Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit BRIEF AMICUS CURIAE OF RETIRED MILITARY OFFICERS IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS, MIRNA ADJAMI JAMES C. SCHROEDER, Midwest Immigrant and Counsel of Record Human Rights Center. (January 2004) The decision supported the President by holding that the Constitution allowed the federal government to regulate economic activity that was only indirectly related to interstate commerce.
 Decision 
The Act's intended rationale was to stabilize the price of wheat on the national market. The federal government has the power to regulate interstate commerce by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. In this decision, the Court unanimously reasoned that the power to regulate the price at which commerce occurs was inherent in the power to regulate commerce.
Filburn argued that since the excess wheat that he produced was intended solely for home consumption, his wheat production could not be regulated through the Interstate Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court rejected the argument and reasoned that if Filburn had not produced his own wheat, he would have bought wheat on the open market.
That effect on interstate commerce, the Court reasoned, may not be substantial from the actions of Filburn alone, but the cumulative actions of thousands of other farmers just like Filburn would certainly make the effect become substantial.
Therefore, Congress could regulate wholly intrastate, non-commercial activity if such activity, viewed in the aggregate, would have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, even if the individual effects are trivial.
Some of the parties' argument had focused on prior decisions, especially those relating to the Dormant Commerce Clause, in which the Court had tried to focus on whether a commercial activity was local or not. Justice Robert H. Jackson's decision rejected that approach as too formulaic:
The issue was not how one characterized the activity as local. Rather, it was whether the activity "exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce:"
The regulation of local production of wheat was rationally related to Congress's goal: to stabilize prices by limiting the total supply of wheat produced and consumed. It was clear, the Court held,
Aftermath
Wickard marked the beginning of the Supreme Court's total deference to the claims of the U.S. Congress to Commerce Clause powers until the 1990s. The Court's own decision, however, emphasizes the role of the democratic electoral process in confining the abuse of the power of Congress: "At the beginning Chief Justice Marshall described the Federal commerce power with a breadth never yet exceeded. He made emphatic the embracing and penetrating nature of this power by warning that effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than from judicial processes."
According to Earl M. Maltz, Wickard and other New Deal decisions gave Congress "the authority to regulate private economic activity in a manner near limitless in its purview."Earl M. Maltz, as quoted in Chen, supra, at footnote 223.
That remained the case until United States v. Lopez (1995), which was the first decision in six decades to invalidate a federal statute on the grounds that it exceeded the power of the Congress under the Commerce Clause. The opinion described Wickard as "perhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate commerce" and judged that it "greatly expanded the authority of Congress beyond what is defined in the Constitution under that Clause."
In Lopez, the Court held that while Congress had broad lawmaking authority under the Commerce Clause, the power was limited and did not extend so far from "commerce" as to authorize the regulation of the carrying of handguns, especially when there was no evidence that carrying them affected the economy on a massive scale. (In a later case, United States v. Morrison, the Court ruled in 2000 that Congress could not make such laws even when there was evidence of aggregate effect.)
The Supreme Court has since relied heavily on Wickard in upholding the power of the federal government to prosecute individuals who grow their own medicinal marijuana pursuant to state law. The Supreme Court would hold in Gonzales v. Raich (2005) that like with the home-grown wheat at issue in Wickard, home-grown marijuana is a legitimate subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce:
In 2012, Wickard was central to arguments in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius and Florida v. United States Department of Health and Human Services on the constitutionality of the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act, with both supporters and opponents of the mandate claiming that Wickard supported their positions.

From "Widmar v. Vincent" ==> """
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), held that when the U.S. government provides an "open forum," it may not discriminate against speech that takes place within that forum on the basis of the viewpoint it expresses—in this case, against religious speech engaged in by an evangelical Christian organization..
Facts
Cornerstone, a Christian organization for students of the University of Missouri–Kansas City, had for many years, with University permission, used classrooms for its weekly meetings. In 1977 the group sought to use additional room for religious services, outside of instructional hours. The university rejected the request, citing university and state regulations prohibiting the use of the public space for worship, as a violation of the Establishment Clause.
Cornerstone filed suit in United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, and the district court issued a summary judgement in favor of the University. Upon appeal, the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court, whereupon the university appealed to the US Supreme Court.
Majority opinion
In an 8–1 decision, Justice Lewis Powell wrote for the majority, that "through its policy of accommodating their meetings, the University [had] created a forum generally open for use by student groups." In order to justify the exclusion of speech from such a public forum based on the speech's religious content, the University "must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end."
In this case, the University asserted an interest in fulfilling its responsibilities under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The Court agreed that this would count as a compelling state interest. But Powell argues that a regulation opening facilities to both religious and secular groups would pass the three-pronged test established in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971). The regulation plainly would have a secular purpose. It wouldn't entangle the state excessively with religion. And it doesn't have a primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.
The University's argument [that to allow Cornerstone access to the rooms] misconceives the nature of this case. The question is not whether the creation of a religious forum would violate the Establishment Clause. The University has opened its facilities for use by student groups, and the question is whether it can now exclude groups because of the content of their speech. In this context, we are unpersuaded that the primary effect of the public forum, open to all forms of discourse, would be to advance religion.
Powell concluded that it was specious to argue that this use of the rooms would "advance" religion, and thus Cornerstone won its case.
Stevens' concurring opinion
Justice Stevens concurred in the Court's opinion, but wrote a concurrence to note a minor disagreement about whether or not the situation even amounted to a "forum".
Dissenting opinion
Justice White held that, while the university was not prohibited from granting Cornerstone the right to use the rooms for religious service, strongly asserted that the university had no obligation to do so. What is "can do" is not the same as what it "must do", he stated. 
Aftermath
In 1984, Congress passed a law, the Equal Access Act of 1984, which extended the effect of the Court's opinion in Widmar to all secondary schools that receive federal education funds.

From "Wieman v. Updegraff" ==> """
Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183 (1952), is a unanimous ruling by the United States Supreme Court which held that Oklahoma loyalty oath legislation violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because it did not give individuals the opportunity to abjure membership in subversive organizations. Due process requires that individuals have scienter (knowledge that their membership or support violates the loyalty oath), and the Oklahoma statute did not accommodate this requirement.
Background
In 1950, the state of Oklahoma enacted legislation requiring all state officers and employees to take an oath pledging loyalty to the United States of America, affirming that they did not advocate the violent overthrow of the U.S. government, and denying direct or indirect involvement with or support of any "agency, party, organization, association, or group whatever which has been officially determined  by the United States Attorney General or other authorized agency of the United States to be a communist front or subversive organization"..
Several faculty and staff at Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College refused to take the oath within the required 30 days after employment. Paul W. Updegraff, an Oklahoma citizen, sued in the District Court of Oklahoma County to prevent the state from paying these individuals their salaries. The faculty and staff members asked to intervene in the suit, and were permitted to do so. They argued that the Act was a bill of attainder; an ex post facto law; made it impossible for them to fulfill their contracts with the state; and violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
The district court upheld the Act.  The faculty and staff appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court.  The Oklahoma Supreme Court upheld the Act.Board of Regents v. Updegraff, 205 Okla. 301, 237 P. 2d 131 (1951).  The faculty and staff appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.
Majority opinion
Associate Justice Tom C. Clark wrote the opinion for the majority.
Clark accepted the Oklahoma Supreme Court's interpretation that the Act proscribed membership in and support only for those organizations listed on the U.S. Attorney General's list as of the date of enactment. Organizations not on that list, even if communist, were required to be abjured.
Clark argued that the present case must be adjudicated within the context of three recent Supreme Court decisions: Garner v. Board of Public Works, 341 U.S. 716 (1951); Adler v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 485 (1952); and Gerende v. Board of Supervisors, 341 U.S. 56 (1951).Weiman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. at 188. In Garner, the high court rejected the loyalty oath adopted by the city of Los Angeles, California, because it required that the individual have knowledge of all the organizations which might advocate the unlawful violent overthrow of the government. Since no individual could have such knowledge, the act was overturned as vague. The Garner court had remanded the case to the district court with the requirement that the individuals be permitted to take the oath, now that the oath had been interpreted.Weiman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. at 189. In Adler, the Court upheld the New York legislation, because the New York courts had already interpreted the law to require that individuals have knowledge of the goals of the organization they belonged to.  In Gerende, the Court upheld a Maryland statute on grounds similar to those in Adler.
Justice Clark noted that the Oklahoma Supreme Court had refused to allow the applicants to take the loyalty oath even though it had interpreted the oath anew.Weiman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. at 189-190. Additionally, the appellants had petitioned that court for a rehearing that would allow them to take the oath and again, the Oklahoma Supreme Court denied the request.Weiman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. at 190. The act, as interpreted by the Oklahoma Supreme Court (Clark concluded) was asserting that "the fact of membership alone disqualifies. If the rule be expressed as a presumption of disloyalty, it is a conclusive one."
The Oklahoma act could not withstand constitutional scrutiny in that case, Clark wrote: "But membership may be innocent. A state servant may have joined a proscribed organization unaware of its activities and purposes. In recent years, many completely loyal persons have severed organizational ties after learning for the first time of the character of groups to which they had belonged." "Indiscriminate classification of innocent with knowing activity must fall as an assertion of arbitrary power. The oath offends due process."Weiman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. at 191.
Clark next dealt with the doctrine of privilege. (This legal doctrine concluded that public employment was a privilege, not a right, and subsequently significant restrictions could be placed on public employees that could not be constitutionally tolerated in the private sector.)Rosenbloom and O'Leary, Public Administration and Law, 1996, p. 190-191. Both the Adler Court and the majority in United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75 (1947), had upheld statutes on the basis of the doctrine of privilege.  Clark distinguished United Public Workers by noting that political corruption was practically a unique case.Weiman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. at 191-192. Additionally, neither Adler nor United Public Workers permitted "patently arbitrary or discriminatory" application of the law (as occurred under the Oklahoma loyalty statute).Weiman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. at 192.
Based on these grounds, the majority reversed the Oklahoma Supreme Court and remanded the case. Clark refused to decide the case on other grounds, such as whether the Attorney General had given fair notice to affected organizations or the differing standards employed in the preparation of the list.
Black's concurrence
Associate Justice Hugo Black concurred, joined by Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter. He also provided a strong defense of free speech:
History indicates that individual liberty is intermittently subjected to extraordinary perils. Even countries dedicated to government by the people are not free from such cyclical dangers. ... Test oaths are notorious tools of tyranny. When used to shackle the mind they are, or at least they should be, unspeakably odious to a free people. Test oaths are made still more dangerous when combined with bills of attainder which like this Oklahoma statute impose pains and penalties for past lawful associations and utterances.... Governments need and have ample power to punish treasonable acts. But it does not follow that they must have a further power to punish thought and speech as distinguished from acts. Our own free society should never forget that laws which stigmatize and penalize thought and speech of the unorthodox have a way of reaching, ensnaring and silencing many more people than at first intended. We must have freedom of speech for all or we will in the long run have it for none but the cringing and the craven. And I cannot too often repeat my belief that the right to speak on matters of public concern must be wholly free or eventually be wholly lost.Weiman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. at 192-194 (Black, J., concurring).
Frankfurter's concurrence
Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter concurred, joined by Associate Justice William O. Douglas. Frankfurter's concurrence provided a ringing defense of the special role teachers play in a democracy:
The process of education has naturally enough been the basis of hope for the perdurance of our democracy on the part of all our great leaders, from Thomas Jefferson onwards. To regard teachers—in our entire educational system, from the primary grades to the university—as the priests of our democracy is therefore not to indulge in hyperbole. It is the special task of teachers to foster those habits of open-mindedness and critical inquiry which alone make for responsible citizens, who, in turn, make possible an enlightened and effective public opinion. Teachers must fulfill their function by precept and practice, by the very atmosphere which they generate; they must be exemplars of open-mindedness and free inquiry. They cannot carry out their noble task if the conditions for the practice of a responsible and critical mind are denied to them.Weiman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. at 196 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).
Burton's concurrence
Associate Justice Harold Hitz Burton concurred but did not provide a written statement of his concurrence.
Assessment
In the 19th century, American courts had established the "doctrine of privilege."
By the middle of the 20th century, however, the doctrine of privilege had been markedly weakened. Abuse of the privilege had led to widespread corruption; the tolerance of sexual harassment, racism, religious discrimination, and gender discrimination; and workplace abuse (such as forcing employees to buy goods and services from a supervisor, or forcing employees to run errands for the supervisor).Rosenbloom and O'Leary, Public Administration and Law, 1996, p. 191.  The courts were becoming less and less tolerant of the doctrine of privilege.Rabin, Hildreth, and Miller, Handbook of Public Administration,  2006, p. 673.
United Public Workers v. Mitchell marked the end of the doctrine of privilege. The Supreme Court openly rejected the doctrine in Weiman v. Updegraff, and a number of high court decisions in areas such as nonpartisan speech, due process, search and seizure, the right to marry, the right to bear children, equal protection, education, and receipt of public benefits over the next two decades continued to undermine the doctrine.Rabin, Hildreth, and Miller, Handbook of Public Administration,  2006, p. 672-674. Although the Supreme Court later reaffirmed United Public Workers in 1973 in United States Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548 (1973), it did so on the very narrow grounds that permitting public employees to engage in political activity encouraged corruption.Menez, Vile, and Bartholomew, Summaries of Leading Cases on the Constitution, 2003, p. 287.

From "Wiggins v. Smith" ==> """
Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court spelled out standards for "effectiveness" in  the constitutional right to legal counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment..  Previously the court had  determined that the Sixth Amendment included the right to "effective assistance" of legal counsel, but it did not specify what constitutes "effective", thus leaving the standards for effectiveness  vague. In Wiggins v. Smith, the court set forth the American Bar Association Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases Guideline 11.8.6.(1989), as a specific guideline by which to measure effectiveness and competence of legal counsel.
In Strickland v. Washington,. the Supreme Court set forth the factors the defendant must establish to demonstrate that counsel was ineffective. First, it must be shown that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable competence, and second, if counsel had not been competent, that the trial outcome would likely have been different had the counsel been competent. 
Background
On September 17, 1988, a woman was found dead in her bathtub, with signs of sexual assault and her apartment ransacked. Defendant Wiggins had been painting at her apartment building and was seen conversing with her on September 15. That same evening he went shopping with the victim's credit cards and took some of her jewelry to a pawnbroker. Four days later, Wiggins was arrested while driving the victim's car.
Wiggins was found guilty of capital murder after a bench trial. After the trial, Wiggins elected to have a jury decide the sentence on the murder conviction.  Counsel's investigation of Wiggins' background was rudimentary and contained only a superficial  knowledge of his history from a few sources, omitting the information in detailed social service reports of severe physical and sexual abuse. The record of the sentencing proceedings suggests that counsels' failure to investigate the defendant's background stemmed from inattention, not strategic judgment. Counsel failed to follow the American Bar Association guidelines in not gathering all such information. Counsel said they had been intent on proving the defendant did not kill the victim with his own hand and had not prepared for the sentencing phase. Counsel presented no mitigating evidence to the jury at the sentencing phase. The jury concluded that the defendant was a principal in the first degree murder of the victim and sentenced Wiggins to death. 
Wiggins obtained new counsel and sought post conviction relief on the grounds that his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his dysfunctional background. He presented expert testimony by a forensic mental health specialist who described his personal history including the severe physical and sexual abuse he had endured and its effect upon him. 
At a hearing, one of Wiggins' trial counsels testified that he had Wiggins' social services records before sentencing, and knew that it could be a mitigating factor in a capital case, but believed that the way to avoid the death penalty was to create reasonable doubt that petitioner was a principal in the first degree rather than present the mitigating factors. 
The state provided a post-conviction review of his case and the Maryland Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's findings. Wiggins then filed for federal habeas corpus relief. The Federal District Court found that defense counsel did not provide effective assistance at sentencing. However, on appeal, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding that defense counsel provided reasonable application of Strickland v. Washington (1984) standards. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court granted Wiggins' petition for certiorari.
Decision
The Supreme Court granted a new sentencing hearing, holding that Wiggins' Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated. Trial counsel failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence such as Wiggins' personal and social history of severe physical abuse and sexual assault, and none of this information was presented at the penalty phase of trial, thus prejudicing Wiggins' defense. The Supreme Court's decision stated that such an investigation is a key component of the strategic decision regarding what, if any, mitigating evidence to present during a sentencing hearing. 
The Court further held that the counsel's decision in defending a client facing the death penalty must be based on a thorough investigation of all possible mitigating factors. Failing that, it must be based on competent professional judgment providing sound reasons for limiting the investigation.
Significance
The Supreme Court attempted to improve on the vague and generalized language in Strickland v. Washington by adding an American Bar Association Guideline 11.8.6. This guideline suggests the content of counsel's investigative efforts should contain "medical history, educational history, employment and training history, family and social history, prior adult and juvenile correctional experience, and religious and cultural influences." This clarification allows for the presentation of psychological analysis without the presence of specific diagnosis.

From "Wilbur-Ellis Co. v. Kuther" ==> """
Wilbur-Ellis Co. v. Kuther, 377 U.S. 422 (1964),.  is a United States Supreme Court decision that extended the repair-reconstruction doctrine of Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.. to enhancement of function.
thumb|right|400px|Drawing of the patented fish-canning machine involved in this patent infringement lawsuit
 Background 
Wilbur-Ellis Company (Wilbur-Ellis) purchased four used, patented sardine-canning machines that were badly in need of repair.They were "corroded, rusted, and inoperative; and all required cleaning and sandblasting to make them usable." 377 U.S. at 423. Wilbur-Ellis tried to persuade Kuther, the patent owner, who had originally made and sold the machines, to refurbish them but met with no success. Wilbur-Ellis therefore hired a mechanic to repair and modify them so that they would handle different sized cans and different sized sardines.Wilbur-Ellis replaced six of the 35 parts with different sized components, so that the machine would pack 5-ounce cans instead of 1-pound cans. 377 U.S. at 423. Kuther then sued Wilbur-Ellis for “making” the machine anew.
 Opinion of the Court 
The Supreme Court (per Justice Douglas) held that modifying the machine to improve its functionality was akin to permissible repair, which Aro had held lawful. The patent did not cover the size of the cans or of the sardines, and Wilbur-Ellis did not replace all of the parts of the machine. No replaced part was patented individually. The patented machine was a combination of unpatented parts.377 U.S. at 423. Although the machines were in poor condition, they were not worn out or "spent"--"they had years of usefulness remaining though they needed cleaning and repair."377 U.S. at 424.
Kuther "in adapting the old machines to a related use [did] more than repair in the customary sense" but it "was kin to repair for it bore on the useful capacity of the old combination, on which the royalty had been paid."377 U.S. at 425. Kuther's original sale of the machines exhausted the patent monopoly.377 U.S. at 425 (citing Adams v. Burke and United States v. Univis Lens Co.). The Court thus held that modification of the patented machine to enhance its functionality was part of the property right of the machine's owner, just as the right to repair it to keep it in good order was.
Justice John Marshall Harlan II dissented on the basis of the opinion of the lower court.

From "Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman's Fund Insurance Co." ==> """
Wilburn Boat Company v. Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, 348 U.S. 310 (1955), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that state law, rather than federal admiralty law, should govern marine insurance contracts..
 Background 
Appellants J.F. Wilburn, J. H. Wilburn, and L. G. Wilburn and, The Wilburn Boat Company, an Oklahoma based corporation, obtained a marine insurance policy from the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company for liability coverage for fire among other things, of a vessel called the Wanderer.  The Wanderer was moored in an artificial lake called Lake Texoma which bordered the states of Texas and Oklahoma.  While moored in Lake Texoma the vessel was completely destroyed by a fire.  The Wilburn Boat Company sought recovery for their loss, but Fireman's Fund denied liability based on The Wilburn Boat Company's failure to strictly comply with terms of the contract.
Terms of the contract provided under warranties, that without written consent of the insurer the vessel could not be transferred, assigned, hired, or chartered and must be used solely for pleasure purposes. The Wilburn Boat Company had been operating the Wanderer as a commercial carrier, and the vessel had been sold and transferred by the Wilburn's in their personal capacity to the Wilburn Boat Co. Furthermore, the vessel had been pledged as collateral on two occasions; once to Citizen's National Bank and then to J.F. and J.H. Wilburn, jointly.
The Wilburn Boat Company brought suit in state court admitting to breaching the terms of the contract, but alleging that Texas law governed the terms of the marine insurance contract and as such Fireman's Fund is still liable (Texas state statute provides that only in the event that the breach is the cause for the subsequent loss may the insured be barred from recovery).  The case was removed to federal court under diversity jurisdiction where Fireman's Fund argued that federal admiralty law governed and as such federal admiralty law requires strict compliance with terms of a marine insurance contract in order to recover on losses.
The Federal District Court found that The Wilburn Boat Company was unable to recover for their loss due to their failure to comply with the specific terms of the contract. The Wilburn Boat Company appealed to the U.S. Fifth District Court of Appeals, which affirmed the lower court decision. The Wilburn Boat company was then granted certiorari.
 Opinion of the Court 
In an opinion by Justice Black, the court explored two questions; 
(1) Is there a federal admiralty jurisdiction rule governing compliance with warranties in a marine contract and 
(2) If not, should the court fashion one?
The Supreme Court reversed and remanded, establishing that there was no federal admiralty law rule governing warranties in a marine insurance contract, and rather than formulating a uniform admiralty law rule The Court cited to a previous Supreme Court decision,  Paul v. Virginia, and concluded that marine insurance contracts, like all other insurance contracts are subject to state law.
 Dissent 
In his dissent, Justice Reed argued that federal admiralty law is grounded in English Law which has long since established that marine insurance contracts require strict compliance, and explained that leaving the decision to state governments hinders the development of a uniform federal admiralty body of law.
 Subsequent developments 
The Supreme Court's ruling in Wilburn Boat has been subject to a great deal of criticism.  Most critics of the decision argue that it was poorly reasoned and poorly articulated. As a result, multiple levels of uncertainty were created; more specifically, there has been a great deal of confusion over which state's law should govern a given marine insurance contract and the apparent unpredictability of the prospective outcomes.Michael F. Sturley.  Restating the Law of Marine Insurance: A Workable Solution to the Wilburn Boat Problem. ''29 J. Mar. L. & Com. 41. (January 1998).   Several critics argue that Wilburn Boat is bad law and should be reconsidered by the Supreme Court or overruled via federal statute, however Wilburn Boat still remains good law today.

Wilcox v. Jackson, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 498 (1839), sometimes  nicknamed the "Beaubien Land Case", available at https://archive.org/stream/historyofchicago01inandr/historyofchicago01inandr_djvu.txt was a legal action decided by the United States Supreme Court concerning the land under Fort Dearborn shortly after incorporation of Chicago as a town in Cook County, Illinois.Carl B. Roden, "The Beaubien Claim", Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society Vol. 42, No. 2 (Jun., 1949), pp. 150-154, 162
Background
The U.S. Army built Fort Dearborn near the confluence of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan in 1804, pursuant to a land concession by native Americans in the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, as modified in the 1803 Treaty of Fort Wayne. Farmers and traders also settled upon and improved land near the fort, which served as refuge during various conflicts. Hostilities with Native Americans escalated after the 1809 Treaty of Fort Wayne, and the fort was destroyed shortly after the beginning of the War of 1812, which led to an evacuation order that resulted in the Fort Dearborn massacre of August 15, 1812.
The U.S. Army rebuilt Fort Dearborn in 1816, but only periodically occupied it. However, even without the military presence, the U.S. government stationed a factor and Indian Agent at or adjacent to the Fort for trading with nearby Native American peoples, as well as to pay annuities under those and other treaties, including 1816 Treaty of St. Louis and the 1821 Treaty of Chicago. Trader Jean Baptiste Beaubien, who had bought a shack and farm next to the fort in 1812, then returned to the area, built a home and trading post in 1816, and in 1822 bought the nearby factor house after it was closed following the previous year's treaty. Meanwhile, the settlement grew. A town was platted in 1829 as part of the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal (designed to link Lake Michigan with the Mississippi River via its tributary the Illinois River), and a real estate boom ensued. The state legislature chartered the Town of Chicago following a census in 1833 which showed 500 residents, among them Beaubien and his relatives.
Meanwhile, on May 29, 1830 the U.S. Congress passed a temporary act (later revived by an act in 1832https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/22nd-congress/session-1/c22s1ch10.pdf  and the act of June 19, 1834) granting a right of pre-emption to those who cultivated and were in actual possession of public lands, so settlers who had improved and occupied public lands the right to buy them from the government.Pre-emption: 1814-1841, available at http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/1194863/FID3381/HISTORY/PREEMPT.TXT Robert McKinzie, the son of recently deceased trader John Kinzie managed to get such a patent for his land his father had occupied (and where he had lived) on the west side of the Chicago River. Beaubien twice sought a similar patent for his land on the east side of the Chicago River, but two different land agents (first in Palestine, Illinois and later in Danville, Illinois) issued formal letters of rejection. Meanwhile, local native Americans agreed to relocate across the Mississippi River in the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, so many expected the fort's permanent closure.
In 1835, upon hearing about further land sales except to the extent settlers already lived and improved on the tracts, Beaubien tried again to patent his homestead, this time at the new Chicago land office. He paid $94.61 and tendered documents claiming 75.69 acres, and seemed to succeed. He received a certificate from the registrar (who had consulted with the local U.S. attorney), which he conveyed (sold) to attorney Murray McConnell, who had established a law office downstate in Morgan County, Illinois and who for a time was a state legislator. McConnell leased the lakefront land to John Jackson, but the U.S. Army again occupied the fort, so Major Lafayette Wilcox was living on part of the tract. Jackson (with McConnell as his lawyer) pursued an action in ejectment against Wilcox.
Future Illinois governor Thomas Ford was the initial judge, who pointed out that the General Land Office had failed to act and complete the paperwork by issuing a land patent in exchange for the tendered registration certificate, and so invalidated Beaubien's claim as incomplete. When Beaubien appealed, the Illinois Supreme Court (in an opinion drafted by his friend Theophilus W. Smith) found his claim valid on the grounds that the Illinois legislature had never authorized the military reservation.John Jackson ex dem. Murray McConnell v. Lafayette Wilcox, 2 Ill. 344 (1836) (McConnell was Beaubien's lessee, and had subleased it to Jackson) Thus, the trial court found for the commander, but the Supreme Court of Illinois found for the lessee.
Opinion of the Court
In reversing, the Court ruled that the original settler of the property did not acquire title because it was reserved from sale by the president under the authority of the 1830 act. Also, no land patent was given and only such a patent would convey perfect title enforceable against the government. The register's certificate was not evidence of title.
Aftermath
Following the Supreme Court decision, the U.S. District Court ordered Beaubien's payment returned, but the military realized the fort unnecessary since Native Americans had left the area. Therefore, the General Land Office proceeded to ready the property for subdivision and public auction as the "Fort Dearborn Addition to Chicago" (reserving only space for a lighthouse and quarters for the harbormaster). The subsequent sale of 233 lots raised $106,042.16 for the federal government, despite the decline of real estate prices after the Panic of 1837.Roden, pp. 157-161 Beaubien had pleaded with fellow Chicagoans not to bid on the six lots which contained his home seventeen-plus years earlier, as well as garden and outbuildings (many previously legitimately from the government during the fort's downsizing). Nonetheless attorney James H. Collins, who had assisted the government's case against Beaubien's claim, bought five of the six lots for about $1000, and Beaubien could only purchase one of them, for $225. Either Beaubien then sold his lot when he couldn't buy the rest of his homestead, or Collins actually evicted Beaubien from his Michigan Avenue home in 1839.John Wentworth, "Fort Dearborn" an address delivered to the Chicago Historical Society on May 21, 1881 in Edward Gay Mason, Illinois in the Eighteenth Century: Kaskaskia and Its Parish ..., Volume 16 (Chicago:Fergus Printing 1881) p. 39 available at https://books.google.com/books?id=PR5JAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA39&lpgAndreas p. 86Gilbert J.

From "Wilkerson v. Utah" ==> """
Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130 (1879), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Utah in stating that execution by firing squad, as prescribed by the Utah territorial statute, was not cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.. 
 Facts of the case 
On November 22, 1877 Wallace Wilkerson was charged with premeditated murder for allegedly shooting and killing William Baxter, to which Wilkerson claimed innocence. Wilkerson was said to have had several disagreements with Baxter prior to the other man's death. Just two days after opening statements, Wilkerson was sentenced to die on December 14, 1877 by Judge P.H. Emerson. He was given a choice of execution between decapitation, hanging, and firing squad; Wilkerson elected to be executed by firing squad. The following year, Wilkerson appealed to the Supreme Court of Utah territory on the grounds that execution by firing squad presented unnecessary cruelty and unusual punishment. His lawyers, Hodge and Williams argued that because of the nature of firing squads, his 8th amendment right to protection from cruel and unusual punishment had been violated. The appeal was later struck down in the Supreme Court, where they upheld the initial decision of the First Court of the Territory of Utah. Justice Nathan Clifford delivered the opinion of the court. This decision would later be cited in Baze v. Rees (2008) in affirming that lethal injection was not cruel and unusual punishment under the 8th amendment. However, in finding the firing squad to be a constitutional means of execution, the Court also held that old English methods of execution such as disembowelment, beheading, and burning violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
 Court's decision 
A legislative act of Utah, passed March 6, 1862, states that a person convicted of a capital offense “shall suffer death by being shot, hanged, or beheaded,” decided by the court, or “he shall have his option as to the manner of his execution.” The Penal Code of 1876 then goes to state any person convicted of murder in the first degree “shall suffer death,” and “the several sections of this code, which declare certain crimes to be punishable as therein mentioned, devolve a duty upon the court authorized to pass sentence, to determine and impose the punishment prescribed.” The court ruled that death by firing squad was permissible, but it agreed that old English practices of execution where prisoners were “emboweled alive, beheaded, and quartered,” publicly dissected and burned alive were unconstitutional. The Utah Territory law did not provide a method of execution, that was what the court and judge decided. Wilkerson claimed that firing squad executions were unconstitutional. All proceedings were regulated and the record shows that the court decided Wilkerson will be taken to a district somewhere in the district on December 14 to carry out the execution in public.
Opinion of the court
Justice Clifford delivered the opinion of the court and stated that prisoner Mr. Wilkerson was legally charged with first-degree murder with malicious intent. He pleaded not guilty and later was indicted by a grand jury. He was given a fair trial and at the end of it he was found guilty of murder of the first degree. The court sentenced him to be taken to a place where he would be held until his last named day where he would finally be publicly shot until dead. Provision of the law states, that every person guilty of murder in the first degree shall suffer death. The antecedent law states that “when any person shall be convicted of any crime the punishment of which is death,… he shall suffer death by being shot, hung, or beheaded as the court may direct,” or as the convicted person chooses. In his opinion he states that a person guilty of first degree murder “shall suffer death”, which is exactly what the statute says. Section 10 of the code states that when a person convicted of murder to the first degree cruel and unusual punishment shall not be inflicted. The Court held that organized territories are given legislative power,"which extends to all rightful subjects of legislation not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States. Congress organized the Territory of Utah on the 9th of September, 1850, and provided that the legislative power and authority of the territory shall be vested in the governor and legislative assembly." "Proceedings in the court of original jurisdiction being ended, the prisoner sued out a writ of error and removed the cause into the Supreme Court of the Territory, where the judgment of the subordinate court was affirmed. Final judgment having been rendered in the Supreme Court of the Territory, the prisoner sued out the present writ of error, the act of Congress providing that such a writ from this court to the Supreme Court of the Territory will lie in criminal cases where the accused is sentenced to capital punishment."
Subsequent developments
Baze v. Rees
In April 2008, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas cited the case of Wilkerson v. Utah in affirming that Kentucky's method of execution by lethal injection did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.
 Glossip v. Gross 
In Bucklew v. Precythe,  the Court cited the case of Wilkerson v. Utah and ruled that when a convict sentenced to death challenges the State's method of execution due to claims of excessive pain, the convict must show that other alternative methods of execution exist and clearly demonstrate they would cause less pain than the state-determined one.

From "Wilkie v. Robbins" ==> """
Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U.S. 537 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case that concerned the scope of qualified immunity for government officials working in the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Specifically, the Supreme Court held that BLM employees could not be liable for an alleged retaliation claim against Robbins, a farm owner, because other avenues for relief were available. Though these workers may have been tough in negotiations with Robbins over access over his land, none of that rose to the level of a constitutional violation.
 Background 
In 1994, Frank Robbins purchased a Wyoming dude ranch which functioned as a commercial guest resort. The original owner of the property had signed an agreement with the BLM granting an easement along a road which crossed the ranch. The Bureau failed to record the easement, and it ceased to exist when the property was transferred to Robbins. Robbins continued to graze cattle in the area, leading to a BLM employee demanding a new easement to replace the old one. At trial, Robbins claimed that employees of the BLM engaged in a "campaign of harassment and intimidation aimed at forcing him to re-grant the lost easement."
In 1998, after a series of further conflicts with BLM officials, Robbins filed a lawsuit. He claimed that the BLM actions violated the RICO statute, a law which bars racketeering. Additionally, he argued that the federal officials violated his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.
The District Court dismissed all of Robbins' claims on the grounds that there were other alternative means of relief, absent a lawsuit. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed, finding that judicial relief was open for "constitutional violations committed by individual federal employees unrelated to final agency action." After a series of proceedings between the District Court and the Court of Appeals, the BLM officials sought review before the Supreme Court.
Opinion of the Court
Justice David Souter wrote the majority opinion which reversed the Tenth Circuit and held that the BLM agents were not liable for the alleged retaliation.
In reaching that finding, Souter wrote that "we think [that] any damages remedy for actions by Government employees who push too hard for the Government's benefit may come better, if at all, through legislation." The harms of "illegitimate pressure" were simply too ambiguous for courts to handle them. Additionally, Souter rejected the RICO claim, finding that none of the BLM actions could be "generically classified as extortionate."
Thomas' concurrence
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a short concurring opinion, joined by Justice Scalia. While he joined the entirety of Souter's majority opinion, he stressed that attaching liability to government officials' conduct was "a relic of the heady days in which this Court assumed common-law powers to create causes of action."
Ginsburg's dissent
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a dissenting opinion, with which Justice John Paul Stevens joined. Ginsburg focused on the Fifth Amendment property issues in the case, arguing that "the Fifth Amendment provide[s] an effective check on federal officers who abuse their regulatory powers by harassing and punishing property owners who refuse to surrender their property to the United States without fair compensation." Therefore, she argued, Robbins had a cause of action against the government and his case should have been allowed to go forward.

From "Wilkinson v. Austin" ==> """
Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209 (2005), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that while the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment gives rise to a liberty interest in not being placed in a Supermax prison, Ohio's procedures for determining which prisoners should be placed there satisfied the requirements of due process.
 Background 
The State of Ohio opened its Supermax facility, the Ohio State Penitentiary, in 1998 after a riot in one of its maximum security prisons.  The OSP is more restrictive than a maximum security unit, a "highly restrictive form of solitary confinement".  Inmates remain at OSP indefinitely, up to the maximum term of their sentences; if a prisoner is serving a life sentence, he may remain at OSP until he dies.  
The Ohio prison system determines which inmates will be placed at the OSP Supermax in the following manner.  When an inmate enters the prison system, he is assigned a numerical ranking based on his security risk, from 1 to 5.  The higher number represents a greater security risk.  Inmates assigned level 5 are placed at OSP.  Initially, there were no criteria governing which inmates would be rated 5, and some inmates who did not, in fact, pose tremendous security risks nevertheless received ratings of 5.  The Ohio prison system formulated criteria for classifying inmates in 1999 and again in 2002.  Under the 2002 policy, inmates were classified either upon entry into the prison system or after certain conduct took place.  A three-member committee convenes to review the inmate's file and hold a hearing.  At least 48 hours before the hearing, the inmate is notified about the conduct that triggered the classification.  The inmate may attend the hearing and offer "pertinent information" or objections to OSP placement, but he may not call witnesses.  The committee may decline to recommend OSP placement, at which point the process terminates.
If, however, the committee does recommend placement in OSP, the committee reports its recommendation to the warden of the inmate's current prison or, if the review took place upon the prisoner's initial entry into the prison system, to another designated official.  The warden may veto the recommendation, at which point the process also terminates.  If the warden concurs, he provides a written explanation and forwards both his recommendation and the committee's to the Bureau of Classification, an agency of the Ohio prison system.  The inmate may also submit written objections to the Bureau.  The Bureau may also veto the committee's recommendation; if it does not, the inmate is transferred to OSP.  
Inmates assigned to OSP are reviewed within 30 days of arriving there.  If the reviewer determines that the inmate is not appropriately placed, the reviewer provides a written report to the warden at OSP.  The warden forwards the report, along with his own report, to the Bureau.  If the Bureau agrees with the recommendation, the inmate is transferred to a lower-security prison.  Otherwise, he will remain at OSP for at least another year, at which time another such review will take place.
Procedural history
Austin and other OSP inmates brought suit against officials of the Ohio prison system under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,. alleging that Ohio's procedure for determining which inmates will be placed at OSP violates their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.  The United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio held an eight-day trial at which it heard testimony from expert witnesses.  It concluded that the inmates had a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause in not being assigned to OSP, and demanded that the Ohio prison system make significant substantive and procedural changes to the process by which it assigned inmates to OSP.  The State appealed to the Sixth Circuit, which affirmed the procedural modifications but set aside the substantive modifications.  As a result of the Sixth Circuit's ruling, Ohio prison officials were required to:
 Furnish to the inmate before the hearing a list of all the grounds upon which OSP placement could be based, and were thus forbidden to rely on factors not on that list;
 Allow the prisoner to make an oral or written statement to the committee, and call witnesses on his behalf in a manner consistent with prison security concerns;
 Explain in greater detail after the hearing the reason for the committee's decision; and
 Explain to the inmate, every six months, what conduct would allow the inmate to be removed from OSP placement.
The State of Ohio asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Sixth Circuit's decision, and it agreed to do so.
 Opinion of the Court 
The Court first had to decide whether the prison inmates had a protected liberty interest in avoiding placement in OSP.  In the Sixth Circuit, Ohio had taken the position that they did not.  In the Supreme Court, however, Ohio conceded that they did.  Of its own force, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not guarantee that state prisoners will not be placed in more restrictive conditions of confinement.  However, individual state procedural guarantees may give rise to a protected liberty interest, as the Court had held in Sandin v. Conner, .  In Conner, the Court held that a protected liberty interest can arise only after examining the "ordinary incidents of prison life".  Short periods of administrative segregation imposed as punishment for violating prison rules thus did not implicate a liberty interest, because inmates in the general population experience periods of lockdown, the degree of confinement in administrative segregation was not excessive, and the duration of the segregation period was not disruptive to the inmate's environment.
The Court did not find it necessary to define what the "ordinary incidents" of prison life were, vis-à-vis confinement in Supermax conditions, for "assignment to OSP imposes an atypical and significant hardship under any plausible baseline."  Prisoners in OSP are forbidden "almost all human contact".  They may not converse with each other from cell to cell.  Lights are on 24 hours a day, though for some periods of time the light is dimmed.  Inmates are allowed only one hour of exercise per day, in a small indoor room.  These circumstances may be common to mere administrative segregation; however, unlike the administrative segregation considered in Conner, placement at OSP was for an indefinite period of time, and such placement rendered an inmate ineligible for parole.  The Court found that the combination of these two sets of conditions rose to the level of an "atypical and significant hardship within the correctional context", and hence gave rise to a liberty interest in avoiding placement in OSP.  This is so despite any purported necessity of controlling the danger posed by high-risk inmates.
Having found a liberty interest in avoiding placement in OSP, the Court went on to consider whether Ohio afforded its inmates the required procedural protections.  The particular protections required emerged from a three-part balancing test first articulated in Mathews v. Eldridge, .  The three factors are (1) the private interest affected by the official action, (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation by the procedures used, and the marginal value of any increased protections, and (3) the burden on the government that adding those increased protections would impose.  After weighing these factors, the Court concluded that Ohio afforded its inmates the requisite procedures.  The interest in avoiding assignment to a Supermax facility must be "evaluated... within the context of the prison system and its attendant curtailment of liberties."  Ohio afforded inmates notice that it was considering placing them in OSP and a fair opportunity for rebuttal; this was consistent with the procedural protections afforded in other prison administration contexts.  Furthermore, Ohio's requirement that it explain the factual basis for the classification review and offer the inmate an opportunity for rebuttal "safeguards against the inmate being mistaken for another or being singled out for insufficient reason".  At each of the three levels, the reviewing administrator can decline to recommend OSP placement, at which point the process terminates.  The Court found this arrangement preferable to Ohio's former system, under which inmates were sometimes placed in OSP without any explanation at all.  Because the inmate will always have an explanation of the reasons for recommended OSP placement, he will always have something to argue against when he proceeds to the next level of review or comes up for his next suitability hearing.  
The third prong of Mathews addresses the burden on the state; in the prison context, this factor is a dominant consideration.  Prison security, particularly the management of prison gangs, "provides the backdrop of the State's interest".  As the State of California pointed out in an amicus brief, "clandestine, organized, fueled by race-based hostility, and committed to fear and violence as a means of disciplining their own and their rivals, gangs seek nothing less than to control prison life and to extend their power outside prison walls." Testifying against a member of the gang can bring swift, lethal retribution.  And because many heinous gang members are serving life sentences, the ordinary deterrent of a prison sentence for new crimes is diminished.
Furthermore, prison is an expensive proposition.  Ohio spends nearly $35,000 to house one inmate in a maximum security prison for one year, and over $49,000 to house an inmate at OSP for the same period of time.  The prison system can devote its scarce resources to Supermax prisons for some dangerous inmates, or it can spend money on vocational and rehabilitative programs for inmates whose prospects are better.  Courts should "give substantial deference to prison management decisions before mandating additional expenditures for elaborate procedural safeguards when correctional officers conclude that a prisoner has engaged in disruptive behavior".  In light of the danger to potential witnesses on behalf of candidates for OSP placement, particularly the difficulty in predicting when certain inmate-witnesses will be the targets of reprisal from gangs, the Court concluded that allowing the inmate to call witnesses to testify at a classification hearing was not required by due process.
Finally, after balancing the Mathews factors, the Court concluded that Ohio's procedure for assigning inmates to OSP is adequate to safeguard an inmate's liberty interest in avoiding being sent there.  The state was not directly trying to take away credit toward a sentence that an inmate had already earned, an action that requires greater procedural safeguards.  The heavy reliance on the expertise of prison administrators also supported the conclusion that Ohio's procedures were adequate.

Wilkinson v. United States, 365 U.S. 399 (1961), was a court case during the McCarthy Era in which the petitioner, Frank Wilkinson, an administrator with the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, challenged his conviction under 2 U.S.C. § 192,. which makes it a misdemeanor to refuse to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry for any person summoned as a witness by Congress. The petitioner's conviction was sustained in a 5–4 ruling, upholding a prior ruling in Barenblatt v. United States.
The petitioner was indeed summoned to testify before a Subcommittee of the House of Representatives' Un-American Activities Committee, which was investigating alleged Communist infiltration into basic industries and Communist Party propaganda activities. The petitioner refused to answer a question as to whether he was a member of the Communist Party, contending that the Subcommittee lacked legal authority to interrogate him and that its questioning violated his First Amendment rights. He was convicted of a misdemeanor violation of 2 U.S.C. § 192. The Court also, on February 27, 1961, denied Braden v. United States, a companion case appealing a similar 2 U.S.C. § 192 conviction.

From "Wilko v. Swan" ==> """
Wilko v. Swan, 346 U.S. 427 (1953), is a United States Supreme Court decision on the arbitration of securities fraud claims. It had originally been brought by an investor who claimed his broker at Hayden Stone had sold stock to him without disclosing that he and the firm were the primary sellers. By a 7–2 margin the Court held that the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 barring any waiver of rights under that statute took precedence over the Federal Arbitration Act's (FAA) requirement that arbitration clauses in contracts be given full effect by federal courts. It reversed a decision to the contrary by a divided panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
Justice Stanley Forman Reed wrote the majority opinion that relied on the explicit wording in the Securities Act and expressed doubt as to whether arbitration could truly protect the rights of investors. Robert H. Jackson wrote a short concurrence distancing himself slightly from that latter opinion. Felix Frankfurter dissented, taking issue with the majority's hostility to arbitration.
Later the logic of the decision was extended by an appeals court to cover claims made under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Supreme Court itself later expressed doubt as to the legal soundness of that holding, and in the 1985 case Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon expressly held that it did not. This led lower courts to begin to overrule Wilko as well, and in 1989 the Court itself did so in Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., part of a series of decisions in the 1980s and ever since that greatly expanded the use of arbitration in dispute resolution.
Although the decision was overruled, one aspect of it survived Rodriguez de Quijas: Reed's dictum that "manifest disregard" for the law would be enough to justify a court's overturning an arbitral award. Later courts and commentators have puzzled over what that meant and whether it arose from the text of the FAA or independently. The Court itself would face that question in the 2008 Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., although without resolving it to much satisfaction.
Underlying dispute
The plaintiff, Anthony Wilko, alleged that he had been the victim of a pump and dump scheme perpetrated by his broker and a corporate executive. Early in 1951 he bought 1,600 shares of common stock in Air Associates, Inc., a New Jersey company, for $29,517.54 ($ in contemporary dollars). He claimed to have done so because his stockbroker at Hayden Stone, Joseph Swan, had represented to him that Air was about to conclude a merger with Borg Warner, which would likely lead to the price increasing by as much as $6Wilko v. Swan (hereafter Wilko III), , at 428, Reed, J. over what it was then trading at when the merger was announced. Swan did not tell Wilko that Haven Page, counsel for Air Associates and a director of that company, was selling a large holding of his, including some of the stock Wilko purchased.Wilko v. Swan (hereafter Wilko I), 107 F.Supp. 75 (S.D.N.Y., 1952).
No merger ever happened, and the stock did not appreciate as Swan had predicted. Left holding the bag, Wilko sold the shares at a loss two weeks later. He filed suit in federal court for the Southern District of New York under the Securities Act of 1933 (commonly known in securities law as the 1933 Act), which regulates transactions in the primary market, alleging securities fraud and seeking $3,888 ($ in contemporary dollars) in damages.
Instead of responding to his complaint, Hayden Stone sought a stay pending the outcome of arbitration, per a clause in Wilko's customer agreement mandating that both parties use that method of dispute resolution. They cited another statute, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which required that courts grant stays for arbitration as long as the dispute was covered by the parties' contractual agreement and the contract was valid. In response, Wilko cited language in the 1933 Act barring any such contractual waiver of an investor's right to take such claims to court.
Lower courts
The motion to stay was denied in district court, but upheld by a divided panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. At all stages of the case the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was granted permission to take an active role in the proceedings as an amicus curiae on Wilko's side.
District court
Judge Henry W. Goddard heard the case. In 1952 he ruled on the defense motion to stay, holding that the 1933 Act's anti-waiver provision rendered the matter beyond the scope of the arbitration clause. "It is very clear that the intent of the Congress was to require that the provisions of the Securities Act should be strictly complied with so that the purchaser of securities would be protected as fully as reasonably possible," he wrote, referencing the statute's legislative history. "A collateral agreement of this nature would nullify the Act's basic purposes and allow the purposes of the Congress to be circumvented."Wilko I, at 78.
Goddard did not believe arbitration offered the same protections as the 1933 Act. While the Second Circuit, which had appellate jurisdiction over the Southern District, had been supportive of arbitration between companies in the past,Kulukundis Shipping Co., S/A v. Amtorg Trading Corp., 126 F.2d 978 (2nd Cir., 1942) it had also recognized its limitations.American Almond Products Co. v. Consolidated Pecan Sales Co., 144 F.2d 448 (2nd Cir., 1944), at 451. "Arbitration may or may not be a desirable substitute for trials in courts; as to that the parties must decide in each instance. But when they have adopted it, they must be content with its informalities; they may not hedge it about with those procedural limitations which it is precisely its purpose to avoid. They must content themselves with looser approximations to the enforcement of their rights than those that the law accords them, when they resort to its machinery." However, this was not one of those cases. "Congress in its concern for the investor's protection and the restoration of public confidence in the industry, must have been aware of the lesser bargaining position of the purchaser of securities," he wrote. "By ... barring waiver of rights it plainly meant to prevent an advantage gained from an assertion of a superior bargaining power." The defendants had pointed to arbitration allowed under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the Miller Act, but he distinguished those cases from the one before him by noting that the FLSA did not have the same anti-waiver provisions, nor had they concerned themselves with statutory conflicts.Wilko I, at 79.
Appeals court
The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the Second Circuit, which heard oral arguments in the case near the end of the year. Chief Judge Thomas Walter Swan (no relation to defendant) was joined on the panel by Harrie Brigham Chase and Charles Edward Clark. They handed down their split decision early the following year. Swan and Chase had agreed, overturning the district court and holding the arbitration clause enforceable. Clark agreed with Goddard that the underlying policy considerations precluded that outcome, and did not require the specificity the majority demanded.Wilko v. Swan (hereafter Wilko II), 201 F.2d. 439 (2nd Cir., 1953).
Majority opinion
"The appeal presents an interesting question of statutory construction said to be of first impression", Swan began. There was no question of the contract's validity, since there had been no argument to that effect. "[W]e must assume that the plaintiff voluntarily entered into the agreement and fully understood its terms." So he turned to the document itself.Wilko II, at 442.
While one paragraph, exempting the firm from liability for any harm caused by the representation or advice of its agents, could be seen as violating the anti-waiver provision, that did not invalidate the entire agreement due to the severability provisions elsewhere in the contract. Nor did the anti-waiver provision itself contain language that invalidated entire contracts that violated its terms, only "[a]ny condition, stipulation, or provision" of an agreement that did. "The stipulation to arbitrate is not one waiving compliance with the statute unless the statute be construed to forbid arbitration," Swan wrote, "a construction believed to be untenable for reasons hereafter stated."Wilko II, at 443.
First, the contract specified that it was governed by the 1934 Act and any future amendments to it. While that could be read to suggest that any controversies under the 1933 Act were outside the contract and thus inarbitrable, "we do not think the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius is here applicable," Swan wrote. It was possible that the 1934 Act could be read as including the 1933 Act, but that was immaterial since the sale of the Air stock to Wilko necessarily came under the 1933 Act as a primary-market transaction.
Swan then turned to the question of whether the statute reflected a public-policy goal of Congress. There was no such declaration to that effect in its text, and in 1941 the Supreme Court had itself said that "[t]he essential purpose of the statute is to protect investors by requiring publication of certain information concerning securities before offered for sale."A.C. Frost & Co. v. Coeur D'Alene Mines Corp., , at 40, McReynolds, J. It thus provided the buyer with a private cause of action, the choice to sue in any state or federal court and put the burden of proof on the seller if the buyer argued the purchase was fraudulently induced.
Swan considered whether each of these provisions could be read as excluding the possibility of arbitrating a claim. As the FLSA and Miller Act cases cited by the district court had held, a statutory cause of action could not be held inarbitrable on that basis. The SEC's amicus brief had not even held that, he noted. "[I]f the parties may agree to arbitrate after the action has been brought, we can conceive of no sound reason why they may not agree in advance, provided no fraud or coercion was practised upon the buyer in securing his consent to the arbitration agreement."
Nor did the choice-of-venue provision preclude arbitration, Swan found.
"The burden of proof provision," Swan wrote, "supplies the best basis for argument against recognizing an agreement to arbitrate in an action of this nature." No guarantee existed that arbitrators would apply such a provision properly. Swan agreed but noted that the court had already declared the liability release invalid, so the arbitrators would not be considering it. And "while it may be true that arbitrators do not ordinarily consider themselves bound to decide strictly according to legal rules, there can be no doubt that they are so bound if the arbitration agreement so provides." A court could always review the arbitrators' decision when it came time to enforce the award, he added.
"The Arbitration Act evidences a congressional policy to favor arbitration," Swan concluded, citing circuit precedent calling on judges to change their attitude to the procedure. "The purpose of the Securities Act of 1933 is to protect investors." He admitted that Goddard had made a strong argument to the contrary but did not find his public policy arguments sufficient. "If Congress had intended to forbid arbitration in a suit based on [the 1933 Act], we believe it would have expressed such intent."Wilko II, at 445.
Dissent
Judge Clark, for his part, found Goddard's argument "very convincing":
Arbitrators, Clark felt, would have natural conflicts since they were often drawn from the business community where the disputes arose. "[This] is surely not a way of assuring the customer that objective and sympathetic consideration of his claim which is envisaged by the Securities Act," he observed.Wilko II, at 445–446.
The very nature of arbitration, Clark argued, ran counter to the intent of the statute. "[T]he great purpose of arbitration is to get away from ordinary legal restrictions as to evidence and proof, and substitute the informed knowledge of the tribunal for the imperfect knowledge of technical matters acquired through ordinary court processes," he wrote. But that latter factor made all the difference to judicial proceedings, and if it was imposed on arbitration as well, "the chief reason for [it] is gone if the arbitrators are to act only like lawyers and judges."
Clark also doubted that arbitration could deliver on its promise of speedy dispute resolution. Even if it did, "it must necessarily be succeeded by lengthy judicial proceedings before the award is legally enforceable." The majority was mistaken, he claimed, in assuming that if Congress had wanted to exempt 1933 Act claims from arbitration it would have included a provision to that effect:
Arbitration chosen by both parties after a dispute had developed was permissible, Clark agreed, citing cases where courts had approved it under the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA). "Because I believe important rights under this notable first of a series of famous Acts for the benefit of the investing public should not be capable of nullification by long fineprint restrictions of the broker's devising," he concluded, "I think the ruling below wise and beneficent."
Supreme Court
Wilko petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari; it was granted later that year.. The Court heard arguments in October, shortly after Earl Warren began his tenure as Chief Justice. William H. Timbers, later to serve on the Second Circuit himself, argued for the SEC as amicus. The Court handed down its decision two months later.
By a 7–2 margin it found for Wilko, holding that the 1933 Act's anti-waiver provisions took precedence over the FAA. Stanley Forman Reed wrote for a majority that shared Goddard and Chase's reservations about the ability of arbitration to protect an investor's statutory rights; Robert H. Jackson's wrote a short concurrence. In dissent, Felix Frankfurter, joined by Sherman Minton, defended arbitration.
Majority and concurrence
After reviewing the facts of the case, its history and the parties' arguments, Reed began his analysis. "[W]e think the right to select the judicial forum is the kind of 'provision' that cannot be waived under [the 1933 Act]," he wrote.
Buyers who arbitrated claims waived the special provisions enacted on their behalf. Even though their claims would still be arbitrated under the 1933 Act, they would have no guarantee that arbitrators would understand it, and in the absence of a written opinion from the arbitrator no basis for judicial review of the award. "[I]t seems to us that Congress must have intended [the anti-waiver provision] to apply to waiver of judicial trial and review," Reed concluded. He explained:
Reed likened the case to Boyd v. Grand Trunk Western Railroad Co.,Boyd v. Grand Trunk Western Railroad Co.,  where the Court had held that a contractual limitation on choice of venue for lawsuits conflicted with an anti-waiver provision in the FELA. There was, he admitted, no requirement to sue as the appeals court had noted. But "a waiver in advance of a controversy stands upon a different footing."Wilko III, at 438.
"Two policies, not easily reconcilable, are involved in this case," Reed began his conclusion. While there were admittedly advantages to arbitration, it was better not to compel it in this case. "the intention of Congress concerning the sale of securities is better carried out by holding invalid such an agreement for arbitration of issues arising under the Act." Jackson's short concurrence agreed with the majority and its reasoning, but was less certain that there would be no prospect of judicial review of the award under the FAA.Wilko III, at 438–439, Jackson, J., concurring.
Dissent
"There is nothing in the record before us," Frankfurter wrote, "nor in the facts of which we can take judicial notice, to indicate that the arbitral system as practiced in the City of New York, and as enforceable under the supervisory authority of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, would not afford the plaintiff the rights to which he is entitled." In the absence of Wilko having demonstrated, much less introduced evidence to suggest, that arbitration would not fully protect those rights, he believed the Court should have enforced the arbitration clause. The majority was wrong to suggest that judicial review of the award was not likely.Wilko III, at 439–440, Frankfurter, J., dissenting.
Wilko, said Frankfurter, had not been coerced into accepting the arbitration clause, as far as he could see. "It is one thing to make out a case of overreaching as between parties bargaining not at arm's length," he wrote. "It is quite a different thing to find in the anti-waiver provision of the Securities Act a general limitation on the Federal Arbitration Act."
Subsequent proceedings
The case was remanded to district court, where Judge Alexander Bicks presided over a trial. Bicks broke the case down into seven questions for the jury to answer. They were able to answer three but not the other four. In 1955, Bicks ruled on the issue himself in denying the defense motion for dismissal of several charges or a directed verdict and ordering a new trial.Wilko v. Swan (hereafter Wilko IV), 127 F. Supp. 55 (S.D.N.Y., 1955).
At the time of the stock sales, there had been no registration statement in effect. Wilko had been permitted to add this as another cause of action at trial. The jury found that Haven Page, the Air Associates executive who had sold the shares through Hayden Stone, did not indirectly or directly control the company. This created the question of whether his sale of the shares was a distribution under the 1933 Act.Wilko IV, at 58
The defendants argued that the 1933 Act was not applicable to sellers. "This contention," Bicks responded, "reflects a failure to distinguish between the provisions of the Act requiring registration and those imposing liability for fraud." The defendants tried to argue that whether a transaction was a sale under the act depended on whether the person offering the securities were issuers, underwriters, dealers or traders.
Since previous courts had interpreted the statute broadly enough to include brokers processing sell orders as sales, "[a] construction of the terms 'sell' or 'sale' which would exclude a sale by a trader on a national securities exchange would insert an exception where none appears in the Act and would operate to restrict said terms in derogation of the objectives of the Act," wrote Bicks. Nor did it matter that other remedies were available under contract law or the 1934 Act; the buyer had the freedom to choose whichever remedy he wished.Wilko IV, at 60
Subsequent jurisprudence
Cases considering and reconsidering Wilko have followed two lines. Earlier ones considered its applicability to the 1934 Act, culminating in Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., the 1989 case that overruled it. Since then, as that and other decisions expanded the use of arbitration to resolve disputes, courts have considered how, exactly, an arbitrator might be found to have expressed "manifest disregard" for the law.
Applicability to 1934 Act
The 1933 Act regulates the primary market in securities, where purchasers buy directly from the issuing entities. Most trading in securities, however, takes place in the secondary market, where investors buy from each other, regulated by the 1934 Act. Since Wilko only concerned itself with the former statute, the question of whether securities claims under the latter were also inarbitrable was still open.
In 1961, the Southern District of New York became the first court to consider that question in Reader v. Hirsch & Co.. Judge Archie Owen Dawson held that the similar anti-waiver provision in the 1934 Act likewise barred predispute arbitration agreements. "[E]ven if the substantive portions of the Acts of 1933 and 1934 were more dissimilar, still Wilko would be quite persuasive in determining the instant application," he wrote, since in his reading that case's decisive factor was the forum-selection provision rather than the anti-waiver language. He recognized that, since the 1934 Act only had an implied cause of action rather than the one explicitly provided for in the 1933 Act, it could be argued that the 1934 Act's anti-waiver provisions could be read differently. But an earlier case had already rejected that argumentRemar v. Clayton Securities Corp., 81 F. Supp. 1014, 1017 (D. Mass, 1949) when it was used to seek an outright dismissal.Reader v. Hirsch & Co., 197 F.Supp. 111 (S.D.N.Y., 1961) In 1970 the Second Circuit tacitly approved Reader in its own Greater Continental Corp. v. Schecter.Greater Continental Corp. v. Schechter, 422 F. 2d 1100, 1104 (2nd Cir., 1970)
Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co.
Around that time, the dispute eventually heard by the Supreme Court as Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., the first case to consider Wilko and its applicability to the 1934 Act, was beginning. Alberto-Culver, the Illinois-based manufacturer of personal care products, filed suit in the Northern District of Illinois after finding that the German trademarks Fritz Scherk had sold them were seriously encumbered. They refused Scherk's demand to arbitrate the claim before the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris per the contract, claiming fraud in the inducement as well as a waiver of their American statutory rights. After the district court denied Scherk's motion for a stay to do so the Seventh Circuit heard his interlocutory appeal. Since the transaction had also involved a transfer of stock, Alberto-Culver further argued that Wilko barred them from being forced to arbitrate.Alberto-Culver Co. v. Scherk (hereafter Scherk I) 484 F. 2d 611 (7th Cir., 1973)
Scherk argued that Wilko was inapplicable. He relied on The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., a case from the previous year in which the Supreme Court had held valid a forum selection clause requiring the dispute to be adjudicated in an English court.The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co.,  Further, as a foreign national, he argued that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over him.
The panel divided. Myron L. Gordon, a Wisconsin district judge sitting by designation, distinguished Wilko from The Bremen by noting that the latter case did not involve a transfer of securities. Scherk also had sufficient contacts in the United States to give the court jurisdiction. Gordon therefore held for himself and Indiana district judge Robert A. Grant that Wilko barred Scherk from forcing arbitration.Scherk I, at 615.
"The relevant statutory language has not changed materially and it is not easy to identify a principled basis for distinguishing that case from this," John Paul Stevens, later elevated to the Supreme Court himself, wrote about Wilko in his dissent. "Nevertheless, since I am persuaded that Congress did not intend the Exchange Act of 1934 to hamper the ability of American firms to acquire foreign businesses, I believe this arbitration clause should be enforced."Scherk I, at 616.
Stevens observed that the 1934 Act had been extended to cover many activities beyond those originally envisioned, especially as American companies began doing more and more business overseas. Since larger transactions, even domestically, often required "an independent audit or other verification of the property being purchased or sold," the protections of the Act were less essential.
Stevens argued that the 1934 Act could permit arbitration. "[I]t is not easy to give the two provisions different interpretations," due to their similarities, he admitted. But Wilko and the practices of statutory interpretation allowed for some flexibility. "What is waived—if the arbitration agreement is enforced—is plaintiff's right to sue rather than defendant's obligation to comply with the Act."Scherk I, at 618.
That reading was not, Stevens admitted, consistent with how the Wilko Court had read the 1933 Act. But, he continued, that case had relied as much on public policy arguments as the text of the statutes.
Scherk appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard the case in 1974. It reversed the Seventh Circuit 5–4 and ordered Alberto-Culver to arbitration. Potter Stewart, who wrote for the majority, based his holding on the international nature of the transaction. But he also briefly entertained a "colorable argument" that Wilko might not apply to the 1934 Act because of the differences in the corresponding sections, such as its limitation of the choice of forum to only federal courts as opposed to the state-court jurisdiction allowed under the 1933 Act.Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co. (hereafter Scherk II), , at 513–514, Stewart, J.
"Wilko was held by the Court of Appeals to control this case—and properly so," countered William O. Douglas, the only justice remaining from the Wilko Court, in his dissent. He dismissed a suggestion that a law meant to protect small investors need not be held applicable to transactions between sophisticated companies, pointing out that Alberto-Culver had small shareholders as well who might have been victimized and "the rules when the giants play are the same as when the pygmies enter the market."Scherk II, at 525–526, Douglas, J., dissenting.
As to Stewart's "colorable argument", Douglas reiterated Wilko'''s wariness towards arbitration.
Allegaert and early 1980s cases
Notwithstanding the questions raised by Scherk, in 1977 the Second Circuit finally held explicitly in Allegaert v. Perot, a case arising from the bankruptcy of DuPont Walston, that predispute arbitration clauses in 1934 Act cases were unenforceable. Judge Wilfred Feinberg wrote that while the circuit had enforced arbitration clauses in disputes between brokerage firms, per Congress's intent to let the industry police itself, "such acceptance does not decide this case." There were greater issues at stake: "This is more than a mere internal brokerage industry squabble; it raises broad questions of policy which ordinarily should be handled by the judiciary."Allegaert v. Perot, 548 F. 2d 432, 436–437 (2nd Cir., 1977)
A few years later, the Supreme Court began hearing more arbitration cases, and expanding the scope and reach of the process in its decisions. Writing for a 1983 majority in Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., William Brennan held that the FAA enacted "a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary".Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., , at 24, Brennan, J. One of his dicta in that case, that the FAA applies to contracts under state law as well, became the central holding of Southland Corp. v. Keating the following year.Southland Corp. v. Keating, .
In 1985, the Court once again heard a securities dispute where arbitrability was the central question. In Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd a brokerage firm sought to compel a client to arbitrate state-law fraud claims as Southland had required; the client resisted citing the need to avoid needless bifurcation. The Court held unanimously that the strong pro-arbitration policy it had found in the FAA in Moses Cone required that split.Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 
Justice Byron White wrote a short concurrence in that case reminding his colleagues that the issues with the arbitrability of 1934 Act claims under Wilko that Stewart had explored in Scherk were still open. "Wilko's reasoning cannot be mechanically transplanted," he said. While the question was not then before the Court, it could not be assumed to be resolved.Byrd, at 223–225, White, J., concurring.
Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon
White's concurrence led some appeals courts to discard the Allegaert precedent when arbitrability arose in 1934 Act disputes. Others upheld it, creating a conflict in the circuitsDurrer, Michael; Enforcing Arbitration of Federal Securities Law Claims: The Effect of Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd 28 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 335, 346–48 (1987). that the Supreme Court resolved by hearing Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon in 1987.
Like Wilko, it had been appealed from the Second Circuit, where William Timbers, who had argued before the Court for the SEC as amicus in Wilko, wrote for a panel that reversed the district court's holding that the 1934 Act claims were arbitrable. He allowed that the Allegaert precedent he upheld might not survive higher review. "Although Scherk and Byrd may cast some doubt on whether the Supreme Court, if presented with the issue, would hold claims under [the 1934 Act] to be non-arbitrable, it would be improvident for us to disregard clear judicial precedent in this Circuit based on mere speculation."McMahon v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 788 F.2d 94, 98 (2nd Cir., 1986)
Shortly after Byrd the Court had also held for the first time, in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., that a statutory claim under the Sherman Act was arbitrable as well as a contractual one in the absence of explicit congressional intent to the contrary,Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., . overruling another widely accepted Second Circuit precedent in the process. In his majority opinion Harry Blackmun signaled that the Court was reconsidering the wariness of arbitration it had expressed in Wilko, at least in international disputes similar to Scherk. "[S]o long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate its statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum, the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function."Mitsubishi Motors, at 632, Blackmun, J.
In McMahon, the defendant had sought arbitration of claims not only under the 1934 Act but the more recent Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). By a 5–4 margin the Court ruled for them, enforcing the arbitration clause in the plaintiffs' customer agreement. In a reversal of its longstanding position, the SEC filed an amicus supporting arbitration.
In her majority opinion, Sandra Day O'Connor not only reiterated the earlier points Stevens, Stewart and White had made about the differences between the two statutes, she added a further observation that the 1934 Act only forbade waivers of "compliance with any provision" of the statute, not "any provision" as the 1933 Act had it; therefore it was more clearly a procedural matter. She found the greatest distinction between the two cases, however, to be the change in judicial attitudes toward arbitration the Court had evinced in Scherk and its more recent cases. "The conclusion in Wilko was expressly based on the Court's belief that a judicial forum was needed to protect the substantive rights created by the Securities Act." Scherk, she wrote, "supports our understanding that Wilko must be read as barring waiver of a judicial forum only where arbitration is inadequate to protect the substantive rights at issue."Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, , at 227–229, O'Connor, J.
O'Connor also had a newer argument to contend with. The plaintiffs had pointed to sweeping changes Congress had made to both the 1933 and 1934acts in 1975. In neither act had the passages Wilko and Allegaert relied on been significantly changed. A conference committee report stated that "it was the clear understanding of the conferees that this amendment did not change existing law, as articulated in Wilko v. Swan."McMahon, at 234–238.
"We find this argument fraught with difficulties." O'Connor responded. "We cannot see how Congress could extend Wilko to the Exchange Act without enacting into law any provision remotely addressing that subject." The passage and amendment discussed in the conference report were specifically intended to assure that the self-regulatory organizations of the securities industry, such as the exchanges and what was then the National Association of Securities Dealers, had legal authority to enforce disciplinary rulings against their members made by their own arbitration panels. In fact, she proposed, Congress may well have avoided the issue specifically with the intent of leaving it to the courts as a result of Scherk.
Dissenting this time, Blackmun read the conference report differently. Previously the Court had quoted, without comment, language calling the 1975 amendments "the most substantial and significant revision of this country's Federal securities laws since the passage of the Securities Exchange Act in 1934."Herman & McLean v. Huddleston, , at 382–83, Marshall, J. "[T]he fact that this statement [in the conference committee report] was made in an amendment to the Exchange Act suggests that Congress was aware of the extension of Wilko to [1934 Act] claims," Blackmun argued. "Although the remark does not necessarily signify Congress' endorsement of this extension, in the absence of any prior congressional indication to the contrary, it implies that Congress was not concerned with arresting this trend. Such inaction during a wholesale revision of the securities laws, a revision designed to further investor protection, would argue in favor of Congress' approval of Wilko and its extension to [1934 Act] claims."McMahon, at 246–247, Blackmun, J., dissenting.
Blackmun turned to the "colorable argument" first made by Stewart in Scherk, calling it "a ghost reluctant to accept its eternal rest" that had received no development since then. It was really a device to introduce the argument that Wilko turned primarily on the acceptance of arbitration, a reading he described as "overly narrow", feeling it contradicted what he had written in Mitsubishi Motors. Wilko had found expressly that the 1933 Act created an exception to the FAA, which the majority did not deal with. And thus, it did not follow that if the court was more confident about arbitration and Wilko had been decided the way it had been solely because of this lack of confidence, then Wilko was no longer valid.McMahon, at 249–250.
After reminding the majority that the Wilko Court had prefaced its doubts about arbitration with a review of the public-policy considerations behind the 1933 Act, Blackmun said even the former was insufficient justification. "Even if I were to accept the Court's narrow reading of Wilko as a case dealing only with the inadequacies of arbitration in 1953," he wrote, "I do not think that this case should be resolved differently today so long as the policy of investor protection is given proper consideration in the analysis." He allowed that progress had been made, but "several aspects of arbitration that were seen by the Wilko court to be inimical to the policy of investor protection still remain." Among them, he cited the lack of a written record of proceedings or justification for the decision, arbitrators' conflicts of interest and what he considered to be insufficient SEC oversight.McMahon, at 257–259.
Stevens, elevated to the Supreme Court shortly after Scherk, added a short dissent of his own. He focused on how Wilko had endured. "[A]fter a statute has been construed, either by this Court or by a consistent course of decision by other federal judges and agencies, it acquires a meaning that should be as clear as if the judicial gloss had been drafted by the Congress itself," he reminded his colleagues. Every court that had considered the question until White's Byrd concurrence had found Wilko applicable to the 1934 Act. "This longstanding interpretation creates a strong presumption, in my view, that any mistake that the courts may have made in interpreting the statute is best remedied by the legislative, not the judicial, branch."McMahon, at 268–69, Stevens, J., dissenting.
In a footnote, Stevens reconciled his dissents in the two cases:
Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc.McMahon, Blackmun claimed, "effectively overrules Wilko."McMahon, at 243. Some district courts agreed. Within a few months of the decision, a California district judge held that it had "so seriously undermined Wilko's rationale" as to require him to order arbitration of 1933 Act claims.Staiman v. Merrill Lynch, 673 F.Supp. 1009 (C.D.Cal., 1987). Others soon followed.Rosenblum v. Drexel Burnham Lambert, 700 F.Supp. 874 (E.D.La., 1987) and Aronson v. Dean Witter Reynolds, 675 F.Supp. 1324 (S.D.Fla., 1987) An article in the University of Miami Law Review told its readers to expect "Wilkos Swan Song."
Eventually an appeals court agreed. Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., a case brought by several Texas investors alleging 1934 Act violations, reached the Fifth Circuit in 1988. Judge Jerre Stockton Williams wrote for a panel that compelled arbitration. "The reasoning in McMahon completely undermined Wilko," he wrote. "As McMahon makes clear, the Supreme Court no longer considers arbitration inadequate to protect substantive rights."Rodriguez de Quijas et al v. Shearson/American Express, Inc. et al, 845 F. 2d 1296, 1298 (5th Cir., 1988)
After an en banc rehearing was denied, the Supreme Court granted certiorari late that year.. Oral arguments in March 1989 turned largely on the adequacy of arbitration to protect the plaintiffs' rights. Two months later the Court overruled Wilko 5–4.
Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion held, as had McMahon, that arbitration had improved enough since Wilko. "To the extent that Wilko rested on suspicion of arbitration as a method of weakening the protections afforded in the substantive law to would-be complainants," Kennedy wrote, "it has fallen far out of step with our current strong endorsement of the federal statutes favoring this method of resolving disputes." The three aspects of the 1933 Act that the Wilko Court had found to bar the waiver of the right to litigate were purely procedural and did not confer any substantive protections.Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., , at 480–484, Kennedy, J.
Stevens, writing for Brennan, Marshall and Blackmun, the same four justices who had dissented in McMahon, joined Kennedy in his criticism of the Fifth Circuit for overruling Wilko on its own., calling it "indefensible judicial activism". He extended that criticism to the Court itself. "When our earlier opinion gives a statutory provision concrete meaning, which Congress elects not to amend during the ensuing 3½ decades," he wrote, "our duty to respect Congress' work product is strikingly similar to the duty of other federal courts to respect our work product."Rodriguez de Quijas, at 486, Stevens, J., dissenting.
Once again, Stevens recalled his Scherk dissent. "There are valid policy and textual arguments on both sides regarding the interrelation of federal securities and arbitration Acts," he wrote. "None of these arguments, however, carries sufficient weight to tip the balance between judicial and legislative authority and overturn an interpretation of an act of Congress that has been settled for many years."
"Manifest disregard for the law"
Section 10 of the FAA enumerates the grounds on which courts may vacate arbitral awards: corruption, fraud, impartiality, misconduct or incompetence. Reed's dictum that "interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard" constitutes ground for reversal has been assumed erroneously by many later commentators and judges to be a doctrine originating with Wilko, shortened to "manifest disregard for the law." While it actually seems to echo a reference to "manifest mistake of law" in the much earlier United States v. Farragut,United States v. Farragut, , at 407, unsigned. its usage in Wilko has survived Rodriguez de Quijas and created an unresolved question as to whether it merely referred to the grounds already enumerated by the FAA or constituted an additional, judicially created grounds. One commentator says "no greater mystery exists" in American arbitration law. Lower courts began taking up the question within a decade; the Supreme Court avoided dealing with it until Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc. in 2008, and chose not to resolve the issue at that time.
Bernhardt, Steelworkers and early attempts to define
Two years after Wilko, the Court considered another arbitration case, Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co. It considered which state's law should govern an arbitration clause where there was diversity of citizenship, so there was little overlap with Wilko. But in a footnote to its only mention of that case, William O. Douglas's majority opinion said "Whether the arbitrators misconstrued a contract is not open to judicial review",Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co., , at 204n4, Douglas, J. citing two older appellate cases.The Hartbridge, 62 F.2d 72 (2nd Cir., 1932); Mutual Benefit Health & Accident Assoc. v. United Casual Co., 142 F.2d 390 (1st Cir., 1944).
Early in 1960, the Second Circuit was asked to vacate an arbitration award on exactly those grounds in a dispute over whether two ships had been built to the contracted specifications. Charles Edward Clark, a member of the circuit's original Wilko panel, noted in his opinion the potentially contradictory nature of the Supreme Court's Wilko dictum and its Bernhardt footnote. While he found the incomplete record available to suggest that the question on which the arbitrators had differed to be one of fact rather than law, he upheld Bernhardt: "[T]he misapplication—if it be that—of such rules of contract interpretation does not rise to the stature of a 'manifest disregard' of law."Amicizia Societa Navegazione v. Chilean Nitrate and Iodine Sales Corp., 274 F.2d 805, 808 (2nd Cir., 1960)
Later that year, in United Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel and Car Corp., the third of its "Steelworkers Trilogy" of cases that set the foundation for arbitration in industrial disputes involving organized labor, the Court gave another indirect suggestion as to what "manifest disregard" might mean. Douglas's majority opinion discussed the centrality of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the union and management in resolving disputes:
A year after the Steelworkers Trilogy, the Ninth Circuit attempted to put all these cases together in another admiralty case where it was alleged arbitrators had seriously erred. Walter Lyndon Pope characterized Wilko's "manifest disregard' passage as dictum and noted the ambiguity: "The court did not undertake to define what it meant by 'manifest disregard' or indicate where the line would be drawn between a case of 'manifest disregard' and a case of error in interpretation of the law."San Martine Compania de Navegazione S.A. v. Saguenay Terminals Ltd., 293 F.2d 796, 801 (9th Cir., 1961) In a footnote, the judge admitted that "Frankly, [this] has caused us trouble here" due to the potentially subjective nature of the test that could be devised.San Martine, at 801n4.
"In this context," Pope continued, "it would appear that manifest disregard of the law must be something beyond and different from a mere error in the law or failure on the part of the arbitrators to understand or apply the law." He then considered the Bernhardt footnote and what this would mean. "We apprehend that a manifest disregard of the law in the context of the language used in Wilko v. Swan ... might be present when arbitrators understand and correctly state the law, but proceed to disregard the same," he wrote. "We think this is the sort of thing the Court had in mind in United Steelworkers".
Courts next began to consider another question: was "manifest disregard" just another way, in aggregate, of referring to those grounds already given in Section 10? Or was it in addition to those grounds? In 1967, the Second Circuit suggested it was the latter, but qualified it with "[a]ny such exception must be severely limited."Saxis Steamship Co. v. Multifacs International Traders, Inc., 375 F. 2d 577, 582 (2nd Cir., 1967) Five years later, it explicitly described it as "judicially created", but raised the possibility that "some of [the FAA]'s terms [might be] construed to be synonymous with 'manifest disregard of the law.'"Office of Supply, Government of the Republic of Korea v. New York Navigation Co., 469 F.2d 377, 380 (2nd Cir., 1972)
Later that year, in Sobel v. Hertz, Warner & Co., another securities-fraud case, the circuit's Wilfred Feinberg attempted to draw a distinction. "An arbitration award will not be vacated for a mistaken interpretation of law" per Bernhardt, he wrote. "But if the arbitrators simply ignore the applicable law, the literal application of a 'manifest disregard' standard should presumably compel vacation of the award."Sobel v. Hertz, Warner & Co., 469 F.2d 1211, 1214 (2nd Cir., 1972).
In another admiralty case two years later, James L. Oakes of the Second Circuit cited Sobel as "[i]llustrative of the difficulty inferior courts are having in 'attempts to define "manifest disregard."'" He considered that it might not ever have been necessary. "[P]erhaps the rubric 'manifest disregard' is after all not to be given independent significance; rather it is to be interpreted only in the context of the specific narrow provisions of [the FAA]."I/S Stavborg v. National Metal Converters, Inc., 500 F.2d 424, 431 (2nd Cir., 1974)
The law around manifest disregard settled down for most of the 1980s, even if the issue had not been truly resolved. In a 1986 Second Circuit case, Judge Walter R. Mansfield summarized over three decades worth of jurisprudence on the issue in another securities-fraud claim:
In the 1990 case Advest, Inc. v. McCarthy, the First Circuit found all the variations of phrasing used by different circuits, whether "manifest disregard for the law" or "arbitrary and capricious" amounted to one underlying standard. "We regard the standard of review undergirding these various formulations as identical, no matter how pleochroic their shadings," wrote Bruce Selya. "However nattily wrapped, the packages are fungible." He derived a standard from the pleadings of the petitioner, a securities firm seeking to overturn an award to a former customer, to be applied to all such cases outside of labor arbitration. "Advest is ... asserting that the relief granted in this case was chimerical: the law regarding damages was so clear and the arbitrators' award so irreconcilable with it that the panel must have disregarded the law and embarked on a flight of fancy."Advest, Inc. v. McCarthy, 914 F.2d 6, 9–10 (1st Cir., 1990).
With the Supreme Court having vastly expanded the use of arbitration through Byrd, McMahon, Rodriguez and other decisions, the issue of manifest disregard returned, with some courts taking a more skeptical view of the concept entirely. The Eleventh Circuit said in another securities-fraud case it had never adopted it, primarily because "the standard would likely never be met when the arbitrator provides no reasons for its award (which is typically the case)."Raiford v. Merrill Lynch, 903 F.2d 1410, 1413 (11th Cir., 1990) Richard Posner, chief judge of the Seventh Circuit, criticized it strongly in a 1994 case, Bavarati v. Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, where future U.S. president Barack Obama argued before him the case of a broker who sought to uphold an award against his former employer:
Volt and contractual expansion of review
Shortly before Rodriguez, the Supreme Court had held in another arbitration case, Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University,Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University,  that parties could, in their contracts, deviate from the terms of the FAA. They could specify when and where the arbitration could take place, and who could do it. Some lawyers, mindful of the unsettled debate over manifest disregard, began drafting contracts whose arbitration clauses provided for a more clearly defined standard of judicial review. That raised the question of whether parties could require more of judges than the FAA did. In 1995 the Fifth Circuit decided that the Supreme Court's pro-arbitration decisions from Moses Cone onwards required that they enforce the contract as written in Gateway Technologies, Inc. v. MCI Telecommunications Corp.Gateway Technologies, Inc. v. MCI Telecommunications Corp., 64 F.3d 993 (5th Cir., 1995) Two years later the Ninth Circuit followed suit in LaPine Technology Corp. v. Kyocera Corp., where Judge Ferdinand Fernandez writing for the panel that "the FAA is not an apotropaion designed to avert overburdened court dockets; it is designed to avert interference with the contractual rights of the parties." Alex Kozinski concurred, but with the caveat that "Nowhere has Congress authorized courts to review arbitral awards under the standard the parties here adopted." He joined Fernandez only because "The review to which the parties have agreed is no different from that performed by the district courts in appeals from administrative agencies and bankruptcy courts, or on habeas corpus. I would call the case differently if the agreement provided that the district judge would review the award by flipping a coin or studying the entrails of a dead fowl."LaPine Technology Corp. v. Kyocera Corp., 130 F.3d 884, 891 (9th Cir., 1997)
The Tenth Circuit disagreed in the 2001 case Bowen v. Amoco Pipeline Co.. "Although the Court has emphasized that parties may 'specify by contract the rules under which arbitration will be conducted,'Volt, at 479, Rehnquist, C.J. it has never said parties are free to interfere with the judicial process," wrote Chief Judge Deanell Reece Tacha. "[N]o authority clearly allows private parties to determine how federal courts review arbitration awards."Bowen v. Amoco Pipeline, 254 F. 3d 925, 934 (10th Cir., 2001) In an en banc rehearing of a subsequent 2003 decision in the LaPine case, the Ninth Circuit took heed of Bowen and overruled itself. "A fortiori, private parties lack the power to dictate a broad standard of review when Congress has specifically prescribed a narrower standard," wrote Stephen Reinhardt.Kyocera Corp. v. Prudential-Bache Trade Services, Inc., 341 F.3d 987, 1000 (9th Cir., 2003)
In 2008 the Second Circuit held in Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds International Corp. that Hall Street had not disallowed manifest disregard.Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds International Corp., 543 F.3d 85, 93–95 (2nd Cir., 2008). The Supreme Court took the case and was widely expected to make a definitive ruling on the question. Instead, in 2010, it declined to do so and decided the case on other grounds.Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds International Corp., 559 U.S. ___ (2010).
Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc.
Despite the Ninth Circuit's change of mind, the split in the circuits persisted until 2008, when the Supreme Court decided Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc.. By a 6–3 margin the Court settled the issue, holding that parties cannot contract for a broader standard of review. However, it declined to further define "manifest disregard" or settle whether it was an addition to the FAA or just a way of summing its provisions up.
The parties had turned to arbitration to settle a lingering issue from the termination of a lease: whether Mattel was contractually bound to indemnify Hall Street for environmental contamination to the site of a factory it rented from Hall Street in Beaverton, Oregon until closing it in 2001. The arbitrator had decided that the statute covering the groundwater pollution was primarily a health law, and so ruled that Mattel did not have to pay Hall Street's costs. Since the arbitration agreement had taken the form of an order from a district judge, Mattel and Hall Street had included a provision that the judge could review the arbitration award, he did and the award was reversed. It went back and forth twice between the district court and the Ninth Circuit before the Supreme Court granted certiorari.Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., , Souter, J.
In his majority opinion, David Souter dismissed Hall Street's reliance on Wilko. "Although it is true that the Court's discussion [in that case] includes some language arguably favoring Hall Street's position, arguable is as far as it goes," he wrote. While Hall Street had argued that if judges could add reasons to vacate awards, contracting parties could to, "this is too much for Wilko to bear."
He also found the term itself too vague to rely on in this case. "Maybe the term 'manifest disregard' was meant to name a new ground for review," he speculated, echoing Posner in Bavarati, "but maybe it merely referred to the § 10 grounds collectively, rather than adding to them." In the past, the Court had "merely taken the Wilko language as we found it, without embellishment ... and now that its meaning is implicated, we see no reason to accord it the significance that Hall Street urges."
In the wake of the case, commentators and courts have remained divided over whether manifest disregard is still available as grounds to vacate an arbitration award. In Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. v. Bacon, the following year, the Fifth Circuit decided Hall Street had settled the question and overruled a district court's vacation of an award.Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. v. Bacon, 562 F.3d 349 (5th Cir., 2009) The next year, 2010, the Eleventh Circuit followed suit in Frazier v. CitiFinancial Corp.Frazier v. CitiFinancial Corp., LLC, 604 F. 3d 1313, (11th Cir., 2010).
Analysis and commentary
With the case's main holding overruled, Wilko is no longer discussed in the context of securities law. However, the exact meaning of "manifest disregard" continues to receive scholarly attention. One commentator has delved into its semantics and historical origins, suggesting that it may be construed more broadly than some of the interpreting courts have held.
In 2007, James Gaitis, a veteran international arbitrator, explored at length the prehistory of the FAA and the cases cited in Wilko's footnote 24. He found it to have a long tenure in American arbitration law, with roots going back to the 1698 English law that was greatly influential in the subsequent development of arbitration law both there and in "In their efforts to apply Wilko's admonition regarding manifest disregard, lower courts were, and continue to be, wrong in concluding that the Wilko Court's manifest disregard language represented newly anointed, 'judicially made' law," he wrote. "It should be just as obvious that in its attempt to apply traditional American arbitration law, the Wilko Court confused one principle and slightly rephrased another, thereby giving rise to the confusion that has perpetuated to this day."Gaitis, 54–57.
Courts focused on the efficiency of arbitration are, Gaitis argues, among those most predisposed to hold that "manifest disregard" applies only to deliberate actions by arbitrators. But "[i]n so doing, federal courts not only fail to consider the historical context that preceded Wilko but also seemingly ignore the fact that common definitions of the word 'disregard' are not limited in a fashion that exclusively requires scienter," he writes. Common dictionary definitions of "disregard", as well as later uses of it by some of the justices who heard Wilko and other federal courts, strongly suggest to him that it was intended to include both intentional and negligent acts.
Gaitis scoffed at the notion that, in the interest of finality, parties must tolerate legal errors made by arbitrators. "[T]here is no policy objective that is served by 'deferring' to the tribunal's erroneous application of that law; the law and the parties both assume that it is the intention of the tribunal to correctly apply that law and that the parties' contractual rights will be determined not by some erroneous construction of that law but by the law as it stands," he wrote. "To hold otherwise is to suggest that when parties enter into an arbitration agreement that calls for the application of a particular law, they agree that the arbitrator can make the most blatant mistakes in the application of clearly established law such that
their rights—conceivably including ongoing rights in a long-term contract—can legitimately be forever altered by an arbitral ruling based on a fundamental legal error that is plainly demonstrable."
Where the Wilko Court, rather than those misinterpreting it, had significantly erred, Gaitis wrote, was in confusing restricted and unrestricted arbitration submissions. "The catalyst for that error appears to be the unfounded supposition that to determine whether there are any restrictions on the scope of the arbitral tribunals' authority, an arbitration provision contained within a contract must be examined in utter isolation without giving consideration to other significant contractual provisions, particularly including a choice of law clause." Wilko's agreement with Hayden Stone had specified that the 1934 Act controlled, but the Court, having read the arbitration clause in isolation from the rest of the contract, decided that that language probably included the 1933 Act as well, since the arbitration clause had not specified any controlling law for the procedure. By thus suggesting that an unrestricted submission was subject to the "manifest disregard" principle for vacatur, the Court contradicted the precedent it was relying on. "Under the very cases cited by the Wilko'' Court," Gaitis observed, "arbitrators acting under an unrestricted submission are free to manifestly and knowingly disregard the law should they elect to resolve the
dispute in a different manner." He concluded that "the Court's misdescription of the arbitration provisions as being 'unrestricted,' together with the Court's use of the word 'disregard" as a synonym for 'mistake,' have given rise vicariously to an illegitimate legal doctrine, recognized by every federal circuit, that thwarts the primary objective of the FAA and leaves parties without a legal remedy for clearly demonstrable errors in the application of definitively established law."Gaitis, 58–60.

From "Will v. Michigan Department of State Police" ==> """
Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58 (1989), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court, in which the Court held that States and their officials acting in their official capacity are not persons when sued for monetary damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1871..
 Background information 
Ray Will sued the Michigan State Police Department and the Director of the State Police in the Michigan Court of Claims alleging various violations of the Constitutions of the United States and Michigan as a claim under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, which had been codified into the United States Code at 42 U.S.C. § 1983. He claimed that he had been denied a promotion to a data systems analyst position in the police department because his brother had been a student activist and the subject of a "Red Squad" file maintained by the police. The Court of Claims, relying on a judgment in Will's favor by the Michigan Civil Service Commission, found that the police department and the director were "persons" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and that the denial of the promotion was a violation of the Constitution of the United States.
Section 1983 provides:
Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. For the purposes of this section, any Act of Congress applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia shall be considered to be a statute of the District of Columbia.
On appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals vacated the judgment against the Department of State Police, holding that a State is not a person under § 1983, but remanded the case for determination of the possible immunity of the Director of State Police from liability for damages. The Michigan Supreme Court granted discretionary review and affirmed the Court of Appeals in part and reversed in part. The Michigan Supreme Court agreed that the State itself is not a person under § 1983, but also held that a state official acting in an official capacity was not such a person.491 U.S. 58, 60–61. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case.491 U.S. 58, 61.
Opinion of the Court
In a 5–4 decision delivered by Justice White, the Court held that neither States nor state officials acting in their official capacities are "persons" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 when being sued for monetary damages. The Court found that § 1983 would not provide a federal forum for litigants who were seeking a remedy against a State for alleged deprivations of civil liberties because the Eleventh Amendment barred such suits unless the State has waived its sovereign immunity or unless Congress has exercised its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to override that immunity.491 U.S. at 66. The majority found that even though state officials literally are persons, suits brought against them in their official capacity were not really suits against the officials, but were rather suits against the officials' offices, no different from a suit against the State itself.491 U.S. at 71. This ruling came despite the fact that the Court had previously ruled that a state official acting in an official capacity, when sued for injunctive relief, would be a person under §1983 because "official-capacity actions for prospective relief are not treated as actions against the State."491 U.S. at 71, n. 10 citing Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. at 473 U.S. 167, n. 14; Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, 209 U.S. 159–160 (1908).
Justice Brennan's dissent
Justice Brennan wrote a dissent that was joined by Justice Marshall, Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens. Brennan found that the Eleventh Amendment was inapplicable because Will had brought the case in State court and that in interpreting the word "person", the Court should take into account the "Dictionary Act", passed two months before § 1983, which said "[t]hat in all acts hereafter passed... the word 'person' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate... unless the context shows that such words were intended to be used in a more limited sense..."491 U.S. at 77–78, citing Act of Feb. 25, 1871, § 2, 16 Stat. 431. In a previous case, Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services (1978), the Court had held that it was mandatory that the definition of the word "person" be construed to include "bodies politic and corporate" unless the statute under consideration "by its terms called for a deviation from this practice.491 U.S. at 78, quoting 436 U.S. at 689–90, n. 53.
Justice Stevens' dissent
In a separate dissent, Justice Stevens wrote: "The Court having constructed an edifice for the purposes of the Eleventh Amendment on the theory that the State is always the real party in interest in a § 1983 official-capacity action against a state officer, I would think the majority would be impelled to conclude that the State is a "person" under § 1983."491 U.S. at 93. After agreeing with Justice Brennan's dissent, he wrote further, the Court's construction draws an illogical distinction between wrongs committed by county or municipal officials on the one hand, and those committed by state officials, on the other. Finally, there is no necessity to import into this question of statutory construction doctrine created to protect the fiction that one sovereign cannot be sued in the courts of another sovereign. Aside from all of these reasons, the Court's holding that a State is not a person under § 1983 departs from a long line of judicial authority based on exactly that premise.491 U.S. at 93–94.

From "Willard v. Tayloe" ==> """
Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 557 (1869), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that courts of equity deciding issues of contract have discretion to determine the form of relief based on the circumstances of each individual case. The Court established a new rule to determine the form of relief: Relief should serve the ends of justice, and should be withheld if it appears likely to produce hardship or injustice to either party.
In the instant case, the Court held that plaintiff Henry Willard had not acted in bad faith by tendering United States Notes as down payment for the sale of property, even though the contract in question specified payment in gold or silver coin. Nonetheless, the contract specified payment in coin, and payment in coin must be made. The Court also held that fluctuations in the price of the property between the date on which the contract was agreed and the date the down payment was made do not create issues of equity.
Background
thumb|left|An 1853 engraving depicting President Franklin Pierce leaving the Willard Hotel.
Colonel John Tayloe III built six two-story row houses facing Pennsylvania Avenue at 14th Street NW in the city of Washington, D.C., in 1816.Moeller and Weeks, AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington, D.C., 2006, p. 133.Hogarth, Walking Tours of Old Washington and Alexandria, 1985, p. 28. Col. Tayloe leased them in 1817 to John Tennison, who turned them into a hotel under the name "Tennison's Hotel". The structures served as a hotel for the next three decades, the leaseholder and name changing several times: Williamson's Mansion Hotel, Fullers American House, and the City Hotel.
Col. Tayloe died on March 23, 1828,Hardy, Colonial Families of the Southern States of America, 1911, p. 502. and his son, Benjamin Ogle Tayloe, inherited the property.Watson, In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe, 1872, p. 29. Mr. Tayloe renovated the properties in 1843 and 1844. But by 1847 the structures were in disrepair and he was eager to find a tenant who would maintain them and run the enterprise profitably.Willard, "Henry Augustus Willard: His Life and Times," Records of the Columbia Historical Society, 1917, p. 244-245.Goode, Capital Losses: A Cultural History of Washington's Destroyed Buildings, 2003, p. 204.
A chance encounter led to a new lease and the eventual sale of the property. Tayloe had become engaged to Phoebe Warren, a wealthy young woman from Troy, New York. Miss Warren was traveling on the steamer Niagara (a vessel which traveled up and down the Hudson River) when she met Henry Willard, a Chief Steward aboard the vessel. Warren was so impressed with the way Willard handled the ship's and passengers' needs that she recommended him to her fiancé. Willard visited Washington, D.C., in October 1847 to meet with Tayloe, who subsequently leased the six buildings to him for use as a hotel. Willard combined the six structures into one building in 1850, added two additional stories, and called the new business the Willard Hotel.Tindall, Standard History of the City of Washington From a Study of the Original Sources, 1914, p. 353-354.Burlingame, With Lincoln in the White House, 2006, p. 197.
In 1854, Tayloe leased the property again to Willard, this time for 10 years at a rate of $1,200 per year.Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 558. The lease contained a provision that Willard could purchase the entire property at any time during the life of the lease for $22,500—$2,000 in "cash" down payment and another $2,000 a year (plus interest) thereafter until the mortgage was paid.Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 558-559.Goode, Capital Losses: A Cultural History of Washington's Destroyed Buildings, 2003, p. 205. During the lease, the American Civil War broke out and property values in Washington, D.C., skyrocketed.Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 559.  Nearly all Northern banks suspended the use of specie (money backed by gold deposits) due to bank runs, and the federal government followed suit shortly thereafter.Wilson, The Business of Civil War: Military Mobilization and the State, 1861-1865, 2006, p. 111; Johnson and Buel, Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, 1888, p. 484.McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era, 1988, p. 444-447. In 1863, Congress passed the National Banking Act, which authorized the federal government to issue United States Notes (paper money) rather than coins made of gold or silver. The U.S. Notes were not convertible into gold, and quickly depreciated in value.Mitchell, A History of the Greenbacks, With Special Reference to the Economic Consequences of Their Issue: 1862-65, 1903, p. 82-99; Kregel, "The Rise of the Greenback - US Dollar - The Fortunes of Money," UNESCO Courier, January 1990; O'Leary, "Repeal of the Greenback Conversion Clause," American Journal of Economics and Sociology, October 1963.
On April 15, 1864, two weeks before the lease was due to expire, Willard tendered the down payment to Tayloe in paper money. Tayloe refused to issue the mortgage and turn over the deed, claiming that the hotel was now worth much more than $22,500 and that Willard had not paid in gold (the only form of cash available in 1854) as specified in the lease.Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 559-562. Worse, due to inflation, the Notes were worth only about half what gold specie was worth.Harman, "Note: Alleviating Hardship Arising From Inflation and Court Congestion: Toward the Use of the Conditional Specific Performance Decree," Southern California Law Review, March 1983, p. 799. Willard sued for relief.Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 561-562.
The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia held in favor of Tayloe.Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 563. Willard appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.
Decision
Majority opinion
thumb|A $20 U.S. Bank Note from 1864.
Associate Justice Stephen Johnson Field delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court.Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 564.
Justice Field concluded that contract law usually required courts to apply the terms of the contract as specified. But relief in cases of equity is a matter of discretion: "When a contract is of this character, it is the usual practice of courts of equity to enforce its specific execution upon the application of the party who has complied with its stipulations on his part or has seasonably and in good faith offered and continues ready to comply with them. But it is not the invariable practice. This form of relief is not a matter of absolute right to either party; it is a matter resting in the discretion of the court, to be exercised upon a consideration of all the circumstances of each particular case."Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 565. That the initial contract was a fair one was not in dispute, Field noted: The sale price ($22,500) was much higher than the assessed value ($15,000), and no one could have foreseen that property values would more than double over the next 10 years.
The majority held that if "the contract [is] fair in its terms," discretion regarding relief may be exercised "if ... subsequent events, or even ... collateral circumstances... would work hardship or injustice to either of the parties."Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 566. "[E]stablished doctrines and settled principles of equity" should be employed to determine the relief to be imposed, and the "specific relief will be granted when it is apparent from a view of all the circumstances of the particular case that it will subserve the ends of justice, and that it will be withheld when from a like view it appears that it will produce hardship or injustice to either of the parties."Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 567.
Two issues now confronted the Court.
The first was the nature of the "cash" which the contract specified be used as the down payment in 1854. Justice Field concluded that "cash" meant gold coin, as no other form of legal tender existed in 1854.Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 568. The creation of paper currency subsequent to the 1854 contract did not alleviate Willard of the requirement that the down payment be made in "cash" (e.g., gold coin), Field held. But the issue did not end there. Had Willard acted in good faith in offering the U.S. Notes?  If not, then no relief was likely: The contract had expired, and Willard had not acted in a timely fashion to secure his rights under it by submitting a cash down-payment. But if he had acted in good faith, then Willard would be able to seek relief from courts of equity. The constitutionality of the National Banking Act was not at issue, the Court said, because the issue before the Court was not whether paper currency constituted "cash" but whether Willard acted in good faith (e.g., had assumed in good faith that U.S. Notes constitute cash, as Congress had said they did).Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 568-569. Field laid out extensive reasons for why Willard had acted in good faith:Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 569-570.
Congress had declared the Notes to be legal tender for all debts, and the National Banking Act made no distinction between debts contracted before or after this change.
Gold was no longer used for currency, and U.S. Notes constituted almost the entire currency.
Almost every state court had upheld the constitutionality of the National Banking Act.
Tayloe had left the city before the expiration of the contract, preventing Willard from discussing with him the nature of the "cash" to be used for the down payment.
Willard had petitioned the courts in a timely matter, expressing his desire to fulfill the contract in good faith.
Since Willard had acted in good faith, the Court concluded, the contract was still in force.
The second issue confronting the Court was the effect which inflation had on the sale price of the property. The Court flatly refused to overturn the contract on grounds of equity simply because the assessed value had exceeded the anticipated rate of inflation.Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 570. The parties had considered the effect inflation might have, and had agreed on the terms. No objection had been raised at any time by either party prior to agreement, and the contract was (as Field previously noted) fair.Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 570-571. But the Court also recognized that forcing Tayloe to accept paper currency valued at one-half that of coin would also be unjust.
The Court also dispensed with a third issue, which Tayloe had raised. Willard had transferred a half-interest in the deed to the property to his brother. Tayloe argued this rendered the contract void because he had not agreed to make the brother a party to the agreement. But the majority rejected this argument: "[T]hat is a matter with which the defendant has no concern."Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 572.
The majority remanded the case back to the district court with the instruction that Willard make the down payment, subsequent purchase price payments, interest payments, and yearly rent to Tayloe in gold and silver coin.Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 574. Upon satisfaction of the down payment, Tayloe must convey the deed to Willard. The price of the property, however, was not adjusted.
Concurrence
Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase and Associate Justice Samuel Nelson concurred in the decision regarding payment in gold and silver coin, but not the reasoning behind the holding.
Impact of the case
thumb|The members of the Chase Court.
Henry Willard successfully purchased the property from Benjamin Ogle Tayloe, and the Willard Hotel became one of Washington, D.C.'s, landmark hotels.Denby, Grand Hotels: Reality & Illusion, 1998, p. 221. It still exists, although the name has changed to the Willard InterContinental Hotel, and it is one of the city's best-known luxury hotels.
Willard v. Tayloe was an important decision of the Chase Court. The case went directly to the heart of Chase's core convictions regarding banking and monetary policy.White, "Reconstructing the Constitutional Jurisprudence of Salmon P. Chase," Northern Kentucky Law Review, Fall 1993, p. 71. While Chase favored a banking system that was national and centralized, he was initially opposed to the introduction of paper money and (contrary to President Abraham Lincoln's policy) believed U.S. Bank Notes should be convertible into gold.Niven, Salmon P. Chase: A Biography, 1995, p. 270; Blue, Salmon P. Chase: A Life in Politics, 1987, p. 150. Willard v. Tayloe and the Legal Tender Cases were "the most significant set of cases decided by the Chase Court".
The Willard decision is a classic example of a "conditional order of specific performance." Courts of equity often use a monetary calculus to judge hardship.Dawson and Cooper, "The Effect of Inflation on Private Contracts: United States, 1862-79," Michigan Law Review, 1935, p. 862. Frustration of purpose can occur when the terms of a contract are applied literally and automatically without taking into consideration radical changes in the economic or physical environment.Corbin, Corbin on Contracts, 1964, §1165 at 225-26.
The Willard court was also wrestling with a 19th-century concept of money that was quickly becoming outmoded. This concept, known as "nominalism," assumed that money had an intrinsic value which did not change.Hirschberg, The Nominalistic Principle: A Legal Approach to Inflation, Deflation, Devaluation and Revaluation, 1971, p. 37; Fleming, "The Impact of Inflation on Tort Compensation," American Journal of Comparative Law, Winter 1978, p. 494. The value of a gold coin of a certain size was always the value of such a gold coin, and inflation did not exist. Metallism (using coins of some valuable metal like gold or silver) is a nominalistic money system, one which the United States had moved away from with the National Banking Act of 1863. Nominalism was critical to the development of the law of contract and the modern industrial economy.Harman, "Note: Alleviating Hardship Arising From Inflation and Court Congestion: Toward the Use of the Conditional Specific Performance Decree," Southern California Law Review, March 1983, p. 800-801. Most nations adhered to it until the 20th century but abandoned it thereafter.Hirschberg, The Nominalistic Principle: A Legal Approach to Inflation, Deflation, Devaluation and Revaluation, 1971, p. 32-33. This trend away from nominalism was under way at the time the Willard case came before the Supreme Court, and it represents the Court's attempt to reconcile this modern economics with contract law.Harman, "Note: Alleviating Hardship Arising From Inflation and Court Congestion: Toward the Use of the Conditional Specific Performance Decree," Southern California Law Review, March 1983, p. 800-802.
The Supreme Court's ruling in Willard also was certainly influenced by the forthcoming Legal Tender Cases.Harman, "Note: Alleviating Hardship Arising From Inflation and Court Congestion: Toward the Use of the Conditional Specific Performance Decree," Southern California Law Review, March 1983, p. 823.Dawson and Cooper, "The Effect of Inflation on Private Contracts: United States, 1862-79," Michigan Law Review, 1935, p. 864-866. The Court was ready to take up Hepburn v. Griswold, a case it would decide in 1870 and which would hold that the issuance of U.S. Notes was unconstitutional.Hepburn v. Griswold, 75 U.S. 603 (1870). Within a year, however, the Supreme Court would overrule Hepburn v. Griswold, and in Knox v. Lee, 79 U.S. 457 (1871) and Parker v. Davis, 79 U.S. 457 (1871) uphold the constitutionality of the Legal Tender Act of 1862.Knox v. Lee, 79 U.S. 457 (1871); Parker v. Davis, 79 U.S. 457 (1871). It would more broadly do so again in Juilliard v. Greenman, 110 U.S. 421 (1884).Juilliard v. Greenman, 110 U.S. 421 (1884). The problem for the Willard court was how to craft a conditional order of specific performance, for any adjustment in the amount of paper currency tendered by Willard would have tacitly indicated that paper currency was valid (e.g., constitutionally issued).Dawson, "Judicial Revision of Frustrated Contracts: The United States," Boston University Law Review, January 1984, p. 32.
The decision is also notable for being the only one of four major Supreme Court decisions on equity which invoked the English common law roots of American equity jurisprudence.Resnik, "Constricting Remedies: The Rehnquist Judiciary, Congress, and Federal Power," Indiana Law Journal, Winter/Spring 2003, p. 250, note 139. Even so, Justice Field never addressed the main point of English common law equity, which was to protect public interests.Resnik, "Constricting Remedies: The Rehnquist Judiciary, Congress, and Federal Power," Indiana Law Journal, Winter/Spring 2003, p. 249-250.
For many years, the Willard decision was the leading case in contract law regarding intent and enforcement."Events Subsequent to the Contract As a Defence to Specific Performance," Columbia Law Review, May 1916, p. 411. The case is still considered the leading decision on frustration of purpose regarding inflation in contracts. The Willard Court's conclusion that coin rather than paper currency be the form of payment (even though coin was no longer used) has drawn criticism from modern commentators, who found it inequitable.Renner, Inflation and the Enforcement of Contracts, 1999, p. 20. At least one modern commentator has characterized the decision "temporizing and cautious". Another has observed that the ruling never attempts to distinguish legitimate inflation from speculation or economic bubbles.Levy, "A Legal History of Irrational Exuberance," Case Western Reserve Law Review], Summer 1998, p. 837, note 165. The fact-specific nature of the Court-fashioned relief has also tended to limit the ruling's applicability.Renner, Inflation and the Enforcement of Contracts, 1999, p. 36. In part, this may be because modern contracts often require an independent re-appraisal of the land prior to sale.Dawson and Cooper, "The Effect of Inflation on Private Contracts: United States, 1862-79," Michigan Law Review, 1935, p. 862-877.
A 1978 United States district court case, Iowa Elec. Light & Power Co. v. Atlas Corp., 467 F. Supp. 129 (N.D. Iowa), has called into question the Supreme Court's assertion of discretion in equity cases, arguing that courts only have the ability to alter the time, place, and manner of payment and not the actual price.Dawson, "Judicial Revision of Frustrated Contracts: The United States," Boston University Law Review, January 1984, p. 32-33.

From "Williams & Wilkins Co. v. United States" ==> """
Williams & Wilkins Co. v. United States, 487 F.2d 1345 (Ct. Cl. 1973), was an important intellectual property decision by the federal Court of Claims, later affirmed by a per curiam opinion from an evenly divided United States Supreme Court, with only eight justices voting (Harry Blackmun took no part in the decision of this case). The decision held that it was a fair use for libraries to photocopy articles for use by patrons engaged in scientific research.
This decision, written by Judge Oscar Davis, has been cited as part of the trend in which the courts will take a cautious approach to intellectual property issues raised by the advent of new technology. Rather than enforce the rights of the author articles by placing a prohibition on such copying, the Court in this case held that this was not prohibited by the law as written, leaving it to the United States Congress to address the issue through legislation.
In particular, according to David L. Lange (No Law), the case was a turning point for the doctrine of fair use: while for many decades the standards applied by courts to enforce copyright (or not) had been "arcana", the 1976 Copyright Act codified some fundamental criteria.

From "Williams v. Florida" ==> """
Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78 (1970), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Fifth Amendment does not entitle a defendant in a criminal trial to refuse to provide details of his alibi witnesses to the prosecution, and that the Sixth Amendment does not require a jury to have 12 members.. 
 Background 
Williams had been convicted of robbery in Florida and sentenced to life imprisonment. Williams's defense had been alibi, and Florida law required him to notify the prosecution, in advance of the trial, of the names of his alibi witnesses, so that the prosecution could try to obtain rebuttal evidence. Williams argued that the requirement to assist the prosecution in this way violated his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself.
Also, in 1967 Florida had reduced the number of jurors in all non-capital cases from 12 to 6, and so Williams had been convicted by a jury of six. Williams argued that the Sixth Amendment not only guaranteed the right to a jury trial, but also required that a jury must have all the characteristics it had under the common law, including that it consist of 12 persons.
The Florida District Court of Appeal ruled against Williams on both issues. The Florida Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case, and in 1969 the US Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.
 Opinion of the Court 
The Court held that Florida's notice-of-alibi rule did not violate the Fifth Amendment. The Fifth Amendment would not be violated if, after the alibi witness had given evidence, the court granted a continuance to allow the prosecution to seek rebuttal evidence (this point was conceded by Williams's lawyers). Consequently, all the notice-of-alibi law did was allow the prosecution to do so before the trial, instead of having to interrupt the trial. It did not provide the prosecution with more information to use against a defendant than they would eventually get in any event.
The Court also held that the Sixth Amendment did not require a particular number of jurors. The point of a jury trial was to prevent oppression by the government:
Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge.Williams, 399 U.S. at 100, quoting .
This function of a jury could be performed just as well by six jurors as by twelve:
[T]he essential feature of a jury obviously lies in the interposition between the accused and his accuser of the common sense judgment of a group of laymen... The performance of this role is not a function of the particular number of the body that makes up the jury.Williams, 399 U.S. at 100.
 Subsequent developments 
A companion case, Dunn v. Louisiana, was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in a one-line per curiam opinion noting that Justice Marshall would have reversed for the reasons provided in his dissent in Williams.399 U.S. 520 (1970).
Eight years later, in Ballew v. Georgia, the Supreme Court held that a jury of 5 was unconstitutional..

From "Williams v. Lee" ==> """
Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217 (1959), was a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the State of Arizona does not have jurisdiction to try a civil case between a non-Indian doing business on a reservation with tribal members who reside on the reservation, the proper forum for such cases being the tribal court.
The Navajo tribe has lived in the southwestern United States and first came into contact with the United States government in 1846, signing a treaty with the government in 1849.  In the early 1860s, the government removed the tribe from their traditional area to eastern New Mexico at the Bosque Redondo. In 1868, the United States and the tribe signed a new treaty to put it back on a reservation in their traditional lands, where the tribe focused on raising sheep and goats.
 Background 
 History of the tribe 
thumb|left|230px|alt=Navajo Indians in period dress for late 1860s, being escorted by white soldiers|Reenactment of the Long Walk
The Navajo tribe came into contact with the United States in 1846 after General Stephen W. Kearney marched to Santa Fe during the Mexican–American War.,  36 (2002). The tribe signed its first treaty with the United States in 1849,Act of Sept. 9, 1849, ; 1  583 (Charles J. Kappler ed. 1904); ,  9 (4th ed. 2013). and signed another treaty in 1868.Act of June 1, 1868, ; Kappler, 1  at 1015.  The 1849 treaty was immediately suspect among tribal members because of the actions of Colonel John Macrae Washington that resulted in the death of Navajo leader Narbona., at 40-41; ,  at 9-10. With relations strained, in 1862 the United States began a military campaign under Kit Carson to remove the tribe from the mountains of Arizona to the Bosque Redondo on the Pecos River near present-day Fort Sumner, New Mexico, which resulted in the Long Walk of the Navajo, removing the tribe from their home and relocating them to eastern New Mexico., at 50-53; Bethany R. Berger, Sheep, Sovereignty, and the Supreme Court: The Story of Williams v. Lee, in  359, 362 (Carole Goldberg, Kevin K. Washburn, & Philip P. Frickey, eds. 2011). The 1868 treaty was signed at Fort Sumner and provided for the tribe's return to the current reservation and traditional homeland, but also for 15,000 head of sheep and goats and 500 cattle to be provided to the tribe by the U.S. government.; Kappler, 1  at 1015; ,  at 11-12. Unlike many other treaties, it was celebrated by the Navajo as preserving the majority of their land for the tribe., at 40-41.
 Reservation 
thumb|right|400px|alt=Map showing locations of Navajo and Apache reservations in Arizona and New Mexico|Map of the Navajo reservation (in orange)
The Navajo reservation was originally established in eastern Arizona / western New Mexico. Although the tribe was promised , the tribe actually received ., at 68. Unlike most other reservations, the Navajo reservation actually expanded over the following years., at 69. Presidential executive orders added significant land to the reservation beginning in 1878 and running through 1901.Kappler, 1  at 875. By 1934 and the last Congressional adjustment, the reservation contained . At the same time the tribe was increasing its land, it was increasing the quantity of livestock, particularly sheep. In the 1930s, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) estimated that the reservation supported 575,000 sheep and 186,000 goats., at 76. The livestock was overgrazing the land, and the experts estimated that the land could support only half the number that was being grazed. The BIA then began an aggressive stock reduction program that reminded many Navajo of the imprisonment at the Bosque Redondo and was opposed by the tribe.Berger, Sheep at 361-62; O'Neal.
At the same time, the Navajo began to develop a more detailed system of self-government, including a court system.Berger, Sheep at 365; O'Neal.  In 1949, Congress passed the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation bill; its Fernandez Amendment which would have granted the states jurisdiction over tribal lands.Berger, Sheep at 364-65. President Harry S. Truman vetoed the bill and requested Congress to send it back to him without the Fernandez Amendment, which it did the following year.Berger, Sheep at 365.
 Indian traders 
thumb|left|250px|alt=Photo of Navajo woman and two white men holding a blanket in front of a building|Navajo trading post in the 1890s
The first licensed trading with the Navajo began in 1849, and Auguste Lacome was the first trader recorded., at 21-22. After the return from the Bosque Redondo, Army sutlers at the military posts such as Fort Defiance, Arizona began to trade extra rations for Navajo wool., at 22.  By 1883, traders were buying 1.3 million pounds of wool in addition to other products raised or produced by the tribe, at 79. The traders, who were largely Mormon, often pushed for maximum immediate production rather than a long-term sustainable yield., at 76-77. About 1885, the traders began to transform from a barter economy to a credit system.,  44-45 (2008). The traders had a monopoly and created a virtual system of debt bondage by being the only ones to offer credit for goods needed by tribal members., at 44, 46.  However, after 1890, the US government prohibited traders collecting for old debts and require them to use cash instead of trader script or "tin" money., at 53-54.
Part of that was due to the nature of the trading system, where the trader could not own their own store or land, which had to be leased from the Navajo., at 24. In addition to the restriction on land, the trader had to post a $10,000 bond with the BIA. Long-term traders, such as John Lorenzo Hubbell or William Keams, established relationships with tribal members to foster long-term repeat business., at 23-24. They began to market Navajo blankets for use in mining camps and as area rugs in the eastern United States., at 28-29. By 1943, there were over 140 trading posts on the reservation., at 44.
 Credit dispute 
thumb|right|300px|alt=Herd of sheep in rough corral on Navajo reservation|Navajo sheep on reservation
Hugh Lee was an Indian trader who operated a trading post on the reservation. Lee was licensed by the BIA to operate the trading post and he sold goods on credit to members of the tribe. Paul Williams and his wife, Lorena, were enrolled tribal members of the Navajo tribe and resided on the Navajo reservation. Williams bought goods on credit and did not make payment. In 1952, Lee filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of Apache County, Arizona and obtained a writ of attachment for sheep belonging to Williams.
 State court 
Williams moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the state court did not have jurisdiction on the reservation. In the meantime, Lee was granted an order authorizing the Apache County Sheriff to sell at auction the sheep belonging to Williams. In 1954, the trial court finally issued a ruling denying the motion to dismiss and in 1955, it found for Lee. Williams appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court.Williams et ux. v. Lee, 319 P.2d 998 (Ariz. 1958).
 Arizona Supreme Court 
At the Arizona Supreme Court, Williams argued that the proper jurisdiction was the Navajo tribal court and that a state officer did not have the authority to sell the sheep. The court held that the state had jurisdiction to hear civil cases involving Indians and non-Indians since there was no Congressional prohibition against it.  The court ruled, however, that federal regulations prohibited the sale of Indian livestock without the approval of BIA. Williams then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case and issued a writ of certiorari.
 Supreme Court 
thumb|left|250px|alt=Justice Hugo Black portrait|Justice Hugo Black, author of the unanimous opinion
 Arguments 
Norman M. Littell argued the case for Williams. Littell argued that Congress had plenary power to end tribal immunity but had not done so, and other federal laws preempted state jurisdiction.
William W. Stevenson argued the case for Lee. He argued that the Navajo tribe was a creation of the federal government and not a longstanding tribe, like the Cherokee. His position was that there was no tribal sovereignty. Solicitor General J. Lee Rankin filed an amicus curae brief at the request of the court, urging reversal. While Rankin supported reversal, he did so on narrow grounds, based on federal regulations of Indian traders.
 Decision 
Justice Hugo Black delivered the opinion of a unanimous court. He noted that in 1830, the state of Georgia had tried to extend its laws to the Cherokee reservation and that Worcester v. GeorgiaWorcester v. Georgia, . clearly established that state law and jurisprudence did not reach into the confines of a reservation. He then stated that the question was whether, absent Congressional authorization, a state infringed on the right of the tribe to govern itself., State Power over Indian Reservations: A Critical Comment on Burger Court Doctrine,  (1981). The Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation ActNavajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950, April 19, 1950, ch. 92, , . 498-502 (Charles J. Kappler, ed. 1971). was designed by Congress to strengthen the tribal government and tribal courts. Black observed, "Significantly, when Congress has wished the States to exercise this power it has expressly granted them the jurisdiction which Worcester v. Georgia had denied." Finally, he noted that the Navajo tribal court has jurisdiction to hear civil cases brought by non-Indians against tribal members and that no federal statute gave Arizona jurisdiction to hear such cases.,  1-3, 106 (1988).
Black stated that allowing the exercise of state jurisdiction would undermine tribal sovereignty and that only Congress had the authority to do so.,  209-210 (2002). The case was reversed.Williams v. Lee, .
Subsequent developments
Williams has been cited as the initial case in the modern era of federal Indian law.  It is widely cited in cases dealing with tribal sovereignty and state infringement on tribal rights.  Some claim that Williams formed the basis for the Indian self-determination era and for the Indian Self-Determination Act.Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, Jan. 4, 1975, .  The case was also the first of a series of cases that limited Arizona's authority within the Navajo reservation.Dewi Ioan Ball, William v. Lee - 50 Years Later: A Reassessment of One of the Most Important Cases in the Modern-Era of Federal Indian Law  (2010)., Williams v. Lee and the Debate over Indian Equality,  (2009).,  276 (1997).  The case is considered a landmark case involving tribal sovereignty.,  xi, 27-28 (2009). 65 (2003).

From "Williams v. Mississippi" ==> """
Williams v. Mississippi, 170 U.S. 213 (1898), is a United States Supreme Court case that reviewed provisions of the 1890 Mississippi constitution and its statutes that set requirements for voter registration, including poll tax, literacy tests, the grandfather clause, and the requirement that only registered voters could serve on juries. The plaintiff, Henry Williams, claimed that Mississippi’s voting laws were upheld with the intent to disenfranchise African Americans, thus violating the Fourteenth Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court did not find discrimination in the state's laws because, even though the laws made discrimination possible, the laws themselves did not discriminate against African Americans. The court found that any discrimination toward African Americans was performed by the administrative officers enforcing the law and that there was no judicial remedy for this kind of discrimination.
 Background 
The 1890 Mississippi constitution included disenfranchisement clauses, including a poll tax, literacy tests, a grandfather clause, and a voter registration for jury members. The poll tax and literacy clauses disproportionately affected African Americans, who tended to be less wealthy and less educated than whites due to lack of resources. The grandfather clause, which allowed voters to automatically be registered if their grandfather had voted, effectively exempted illiterate whites, but not blacks, from the literacy test.“Voting Rights Act.” Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/event/Voting-Rights-Act#ref809346. Accessed 7 March 2020. Blacks received the right to vote in 1870 under the Fifteenth Amendment,”15th Amendment.” History.com, https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/fifteenth-amendment. Accessed 7 March 2020. so almost no African Americans at this time had voting grandfathers because they were among the first generations of African American voters. Jury members were required to be registered voters, which meant that most jury members were white, since there were so many obstacles presented to African Americans to keep them from voting. Mississippi’s constitution itself was ratified by a constitutional convention of 134, of which all but one member were white. The members of the constitutional convention also refused to submit the constitution to the state’s voters for approval, instead ordering it to be adopted immediately.
 Trial 
In 1896 in the Circuit Court of Washington County, Mississippi, the plaintiff, Henry Williams, had been indicted for murder by an all-white grand jury, and convicted by an all-white petit jury and sentenced to be hanged. The plaintiff challenged the jury selection as the jury was selected from eligible voters and the plaintiff alleged the trial was inappropriate as the "defendant's race would have been represented impartially on the grand jury which presented this indictment," and that he was deprived of equal protection under the law. He made a motion to quash the indictment on the grounds that the jury was selected under discriminatory laws in Mississippi’s constitution, which violated the Fourteenth Amendment. His motion was denied because, according to the court, the law itself was written in a way that it could be applied to everyone. Williams then made a motion for the case to be taken to federal court, which was denied; he made another motion for a retrial, which was also denied.
 Appeals 
An appeal was taken by the Mississippi Supreme Court. Williams made the same argument that the jury that convicted him was made under discriminatory laws, but the Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the ruling that the laws themselves were not discriminatory. Williams appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which took the case in 1898, with the argument that the voting laws in the 1890 Mississippi Constitution violated the Fourteenth Amendment.
 Decision 
The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously rejected Williams' contention in a 9-0 vote, ruling that he had not shown that the administration of the Mississippi suffrage provision was discriminatory. Justice Joseph McKenna wrote the opinion, stating, “The constitution of Mississippi and its statutes do not on their face discriminate between the races, and it has not been shown that their actual administration was evil; only that evil was possible under them.” This statement held even after the state admitted that its administration of these provisions had been carried out with a discriminatory intent. Essentially, the court ruled that, since the laws had the potential to be applied to anyone, they were technically nondiscriminatory. Any targeting of African Americans specifically was the result of bias in the people enforcing the laws; the laws themselves did not discriminate, they only gave administrative officers the option to discriminate, which was not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
 Aftermath 
Other southern states created new constitutions with provisions similar to those of Mississippi's through 1908, effectively disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites for decades.
Although some northern Congressmen proposed reducing southern states' apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives to reflect the numbers of African Americans who were disenfranchised, no action was passed. With one-party rule, white Southern Democrats had a powerful voting block which they exercised for decades, for instance, to reject any Federal legislation against lynching. (See Section Two of the 14th Amendment.)
The Supreme Court indirectly overturned one aspect of this decision in Guinn v. United States in 1915 where it held that the use of grandfather clauses to enable whites to avoid the literacy tests used to exclude blacks was unconstitutional.

From "Williams v. North Carolina (1942)" ==> """
Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287 (1942), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the federal government determines marriage and divorce statuses between state lines.Williams v. North Carolina, .  Mr. Williams and Ms. Hendrix moved to Nevada and filed for divorce from their respective spouses. Once the divorces were final Mr. Williams and Ms. Hendrix were married and then moved back to North Carolina. They lived there together until they were charged by the state of North Carolina for bigamous cohabitation.
 Background 
In 1942, divorce was not widely accepted in the United States. In 1942 the annual divorce rate was 10.1 per 1,000 married women, lower than the 2015 rate of 16.9 per 1,000 and much lower than the 1980 peak of nearly 23 per 1,000.  
In 1916 Mr. Williams married Ms. Carrie Wyke in North Carolina and resided there until May 1940. In 1920 Ms. Hendrix married Mr. Thomas Hendrix and lived in North Carolina until May 1940. In June 1940 Mr. Williams and Ms. Hendrix moved to Las Vegas, Nevada and on June 26, each filed for a divorce from their respective spouse. “The defendants in those divorce actions entered no appearance nor were they served with process in Nevada. In the case of defendant Thomas Hendrix service by publication was had by publication of the summons in a Las Vegas newspaper and by mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to his last post office address. In the case of defendant Carrie Williams a North Carolina sheriff delivered to her in North Carolina a copy of the summons and complaint”. Mr. Williams was given a decree of divorce on August 26, 1940 by the state of Nevada on the grounds of extreme cruelty, the court finding that 'the plaintiff has been and now is a bona fide and continuous resident of the County of Clark, State of Nevada, and had been such resident for more than six weeks immediately preceding the commencement of this action in the manner prescribed by law'. It was not until October 4, 1940 that Ms. Hendrix was declared divorced on the grounds of willful neglect and extreme cruelty and made the same finding as to this petitioner's bona fide residence in Nevada as it made in the case of Williams. On that same day, October 4, 1940, Mr. Williams and Ms. Hendrix were married in Las Vegas, Nevada. Soon after their marriage they returned to North Carolina where they lived together as man and wife until a lawsuit was filed against them.
Mr. Williams and Ms. Hendrix were prosecuted under the North Carolina law for bigamous cohabitation. They pleaded not guilty by offering copies of the Nevada divorce decree and argued that the divorce papers and their Nevada marriage were legal in both Nevada and North Carolina. The state of North Carolina argued that since neither of the defendants in the Nevada divorce were in Nevada nor entered an appeal there, North Carolina would not acknowledge the divorce in Nevada under the rule of Pridgen v. Pridgen.Pridgen v. Pridgen, 203 N.C. 533, 166 S.E. 591 (1932). Furthermore, the state suggested that Mr. Williams and Ms. Hendrix did not go to Nevada to set up a bona fide residence but rather to take advantage of the laws of Nevada, where it is easier to get divorced than in North Carolina (as it only took 6 weeks to obtain a divorce in Nevada), to obtain a divorce through fraud upon that court.
 Opinion of the Court 
The Supreme Court of North Carolina, in affirming the judgment,State v. Williams, 220 N.C. 445, 17 S.E.2d 769 (1941). declared that North Carolina was not required to recognize the Nevada decrees under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution (Art. IV, 1) by reason of Haddock v. Haddock..  The inkling from the majority opinion that the Nevada divorces were untrustworthy suggests that the second theory on which the state tried the case may have been an alternative ground for the decision below. It was adequate to sustain the judgment under the rule of Bell v. Bell—a case in which the Court held that a decree of divorce was not entitled to full faith and credit when it had been granted on constructive service by the courts of Nevada, a state in which neither spouse was domiciled.. But there are two reasons why the jury did not reach that issue in this case. In the first place, North Carolina does not seek to sustain the judgment below on that ground. Moreover it admits that there probably is enough evidence in the record to require that petitioners be considered 'to have been actually domiciled in Nevada.' In the second place, the verdict against petitioners was a general one. “It was there held that a divorce granted by Nevada, on a finding that one spouse was domiciled in Nevada, must be respected in North Carolina, where Nevada's finding of domicile was not questioned though the other spouse had neither appeared nor been served with process in Nevada and though recognition of such a divorce offended the policy of North Carolina.” The ruling: both Mr. Williams and Ms. Hendrix were “convicted of bigamous cohabitation” and were sentenced to a term of years in a state prison.
 Subsequent developments 
Once the decision was made in the Williams et al. v. State of North Carolina trial, the ruling stood for two years before being called back to trial in 1944 to reexamine the decision.  “The record from the 1942 trial did not present the question whether North Carolina had the power to refuse full faith and credit to Nevada divorce decrees because, contrary to the findings of the Nevada court, North Carolina finds that no bona fide domicile was acquired in Nevada.” The Supreme Court ruled that, “The Nevada divorces were valid, and must be given full faith and credit by North Carolina, if the travelers really were domiciled in Nevada when they received their divorces. However, domicile was a jurisdictional requirement for the Nevada courts; North Carolina might constitutionally retry the issue of the previous Nevada domicile, and, if its courts found that domicile lacking, might punish its straying residents.”  This solution soon fell apart. The court met in 1948 and decided that if both husband and wife appeared in the Nevada proceedings then neither could later challenge the divorce by way of ‘collateral attack.’ This also meant that a third party could not attack the judgment.
Since the Williams et al. v. State of North Carolina case from 1942, American law in this area has changed in two distinct but related ways. “First, all 50 states (as of 1985) now permit the dissolution of marriage on at least one ‘no fault’ ground. Second, in a variety of contexts the Supreme Court has recognized not only a constitutional right to marry but a broad freedom of intimate association.”  It is unlikely that a state would go to such great lengths to preserve a marriage against the will of one spouse and that the trial would be given the same weight today that it was given in the 1940s.

Williams v. Pennsylvania, 579 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a prosecutor involved in seeking the death penalty for a defendant should recuse himself if asked to judge an appeal in the capital case.SCOTUSblog coverage.
 Background 
Terrance Williams was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder and robbery of Amos Norwood and then appealed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.   The Chief Justice of the state court by that point was Ronald Castille, who had been the local District Attorney of Philadelphia throughout Williams' trial, sentencing, and appeal, and who had personally authorized his office to seek the death penalty in this case. The attorneys for Williams asked the justice to recuse himself but Castille refused.
 Opinion of the Court 
Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy authored the majority opinion.

From "Williams v. Rhodes" ==> """
Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23 (1968), is a decision by the United States Supreme Court which held that Ohio had violated the equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of two political parties by refusing to print their candidates' names on the ballot.
Background
Facts
Separate suits were brought by the American Independent Party and the Socialist Labor Party, challenging the validity of Ohio election laws insofar as they precluded the parties' being placed on the ballots to choose electors pledged to particular candidates for the Presidency and Vice Presidency of the United States; the attack on the validity of these laws was rested on the ground that they violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment—on the ground that they denied plaintiffs and the voters who might wish to vote for them the equal protection of the laws, guaranteed against state abridgment by the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.
Under the Ohio election laws a new political party seeking ballot position in presidential elections must obtain petitions signed by qualified electors totaling 15% of the number of ballots cast in the last gubernatorial election and must file these petitions early in February of the election year. These requirements and other restrictive statutory provisions virtually preclude a new party's qualifying for ballot position and no provision exists for independent candidates doing so. The Republican and Democratic Parties may retain their ballot positions by polling 10% of the votes in the last gubernatorial election and need not obtain signature petitions. The Ohio American Independent Party (an appellant in No. 543), was formed in January 1968, and during the next six months by securing over 450,000 signatures exceeded the 15% requirement but was denied ballot position because the February deadline had expired. The Socialist Labor Party (an appellant in No. 544), an old party with a small membership, could not meet the 15% requirement. Both Parties brought actions challenging the Ohio election laws as violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
District court
A three-judge District Court held those laws unconstitutional and ruled that the Parties were entitled to write-in space but not ballot position.
In both cases, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio ruled that the restrictive Ohio election laws unconstitutional but refused to grant the plaintiffs the full relief they had sought.  It held that a series of restrictive Ohio election laws resulted in a denial of equal protection of the laws but refused to grant plaintiffs the full relief they sought against defendants, a governor and associated individuals. The District Court, composed of three judges, held the election laws unconstitutional, and granted relief only to the extent of allowing write-in ballots, but refused to order the names of the parties to be printed on the ballots. (290 F Supp 983.)
Interlocutory relief
The Parties appealed to this Court. The Independent Party immediately sought interlocutory relief from MR. JUSTICE STEWART, which he granted by order after a hearing at which Ohio represented that it could place the Party's name on the ballot without disrupting the election if there was not a long delay. Several days after that order the Socialist Labor Party sought a stay which he denied because of that Party's failure to move quickly for relief, the State having represented that at that time the granting of relief would disrupt the election.
Immediately after entry of the District Court's judgment, the American Independent Party sought and obtained from Stewart, J., as Circuit Justice, an injunction ordering the party's candidates to be placed on the ballot pending appeal. (21 L Ed 2d 69, 89 S Ct 1.) A like motion filed by the Socialist Labor Party several days later was denied by the Circuit Justice because of the party's failure to move quickly to obtain relief. (21 L Ed 2d 72, 89 S Ct 3.)
Certiorari and arguments
Both parties appealed.  October 7, 1968, Argued.
Opinion of the Court
On appeal, the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed in the Socialist Labor Case, but modified the District Court's judgment in the American Independent Party Case, granting that party the right to have its name printed on the ballot.  Black wrote for a 5-4 court.
The Court held that defendants had failed to show any "compelling interest" that would justify imposing heavy burdens on the right to vote and to associate. The totality of the Ohio restrictive laws imposed a burden on voting and associational rights, which the court held was invidious discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.
It was held that (1) the equal protection clause was violated by the Ohio election laws, which made it virtually impossible for any party except the Republican and Democratic Parties to qualify on the ballot, and (2) the American Independent Party was, and the Socialist Labor Party was not, entitled to have its name placed on the ballots, because the former promptly sought injunctive relief in the United States Supreme Court, thus avoiding interruption of the state's electoral process, and the latter delayed in seeking such relief.
Held:
1. The controversy in these cases is justiciable.  P. 28.
2. State laws enacted pursuant to Art. II, § 1, of the Constitution to regulate the selection of electors must meet the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. pp. 28–29.
3. Ohio's restrictive election laws taken as a whole are invidiously discriminatory and  violate the Equal Protection Clause because they give the two old, established parties a decided advantage over new parties. pp. 30–34.
(a) The state laws here involved heavily burden the right of individuals to associate for the advancement of political beliefs and the right of qualified voters to cast their votes effectively. pp. 30–31.
(b) The State has shown no "compelling interest" justifying those burdens.  pp. 31–32.
4. Under the circumstances here Ohio must allow the Independent Party and its candidates for President and Vice President to remain on the ballot, subject to compliance with valid state laws. Ohio is not at this late date required to place the Socialist Labor Party on the ballot for the coming election. pp. 34–35.
Other opinions
Concurrence
Justice Douglas, in a separate opinion, with emphasis somewhat different from the court's, joined in the court's opinion.
Concurrence with results
Justice Harlan concurred in the results, but would rest the decision entirely on the proposition that Ohio's statutory scheme violated the basic rights of political association assured by the First Amendment, which are protected against state infringement under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Concurrence/dissents
Justice Stewart dissented with respect to the American Independent Party, expressing the view that the Ohio election laws were within the power of the Ohio legislature. However, he concurred in No. 544 in the denial of equitable relief to the Socialist Labor Party.
Justice White also dissented with respect to the American Independent Party, expressing the view that neither the due process clause nor the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited Ohio from requiring that the appointment of presidential electors be carried out through the political party process, and concurred in No. 544 insofar as the Socialist Party was denied relief in the Supreme Court.
Dissent
Chief Justice Warren dissented, expressing the view that Ohio should not be compelled to place the candidates of either the American Independent Party or the Socialist Labor Party on the ballot for the impending presidential election. As regards the latter party, he would remand to the District Court for a clearer determination of the serious constitutional questions raised in the instant cases.

From "Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar" ==> """
Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar, 575 U.S. 433 (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that the First Amendment did not prohibit states from barring judges and judicial candidates from personally soliciting funds for their election campaigns since that specific restriction on candidate's speech was deemed to be narrowly tailored to serve the compelling interest of keeping the judiciary impartial.Andrew Lessig, "Williams-Yulee v. The Florida Bar: Judicial Elections as the Exception", The DIGEST: National Italian American Bar Association Law Journal, Apr. 24, 2016. It is a rare instance of a government regulation passing strict scrutiny.
At issue in the case was a Florida law which barred judges from personally soliciting campaign funds. However, judges could still set up a committee in order to raise campaign funds. Williams-Yulee was a judicial candidate in Hillsborough County, Florida, who sent out a soliciting letter for campaign contributions. She also posted the letter to her website. Williams-Yulee lost her campaign to the incumbent judge. The Florida Bar filed a complaint against her for violating the law shortly afterwards.
The effects of the ruling has been a point of discussion among academics. For instance, Josh Wheeler writing for SCOTUSBlog raised concerns about greater restrictions on judicial speech and the weakening of the strict scrutiny standard.

From "Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City" ==> """
Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172 (1985), is a U.S. Supreme Court case that limited access to federal court for plaintiffs alleging uncompensated takings of private property under the Fifth Amendment..  In June 2019, this case was overruled in part by the Court's decision in Knick v. Township of Scott, Pennsylvania.https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-647_m648.pdf 
 Facts of the case 
In 1973, the Williamson County (Tennessee) Regional Planning Commission approved a preliminary plat for a  residential subdivision, including a golf course, open space, and 736 residential units. Four years later, after the developer had incurred substantial costs installing infrastructure and had received final approval for the construction of the first 212 units, the county changed its zoning ordinance and adopted more stringent density limits.
Upon submission of a revised preliminary plat in 1980, the Commission raised eight objections to the development based on non-compliance with the county's then-existing zoning and development regulations. Following an administrative appeal, the County Board of Zoning Appeals ruled that the Commission should have applied the regulations and zoning that were in effect in 1973, when the original preliminary plat was filed. However, the Commission declined to follow this directive, and once again disapproved the revised plat.
Hamilton Bank, which had acquired the undeveloped property through foreclosure, filed suit in federal court, alleging that the Commission's actions amounted to a regulatory taking of its property without just compensation. Alternatively, Hamilton argued that the Agency's actions violated the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment and should be set aside.
 Prior history 
After trial, a jury found that the Commission's regulations violated the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and awarded Hamilton $350,000 in compensation. The District Court issued an injunction requiring the Commission to apply its 1973 regulations to Hamilton's development plat, but set aside award of compensation on the grounds that Hamilton's loss of the beneficial use of the property had been only temporary.473 U.S. at 182-83. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and reinstated the jury's award, holding that just compensation was mandated by the Fifth Amendment when land-use regulations deprive an owner of all economically viable use of property, for the period during which they are in effect.473 U.S. at 183-84.
The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine whether monetary compensation is required when an owner is temporarily deprived of the beneficial use of land by operation of government regulations, but it did not resolve that issue.
Decision of the Court
Justice Blackmun, writing for the Court, held that Hamilton Bank's takings claim was not ripe for adjudication. The Court set out two independent requirements plaintiffs must meet before bringing a Fifth Amendment takings case in federal court.
First, the government entity charged with a taking must have reached "a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue."473 U.S. at 186. Here, neither the developer nor the bank had applied for variances that might have resolved five of the Commission's eight objections to the project. Liability for just compensation under the Fifth Amendment depends on a fact-intensive inquiry into the economic impact of regulations and their effect on the owner's investment-backed expectations,See . but those issues cannot be determined until the defendant agency "has arrived at a final, definitive position regarding how it will apply the regulations at issue to the particular land in question."473 U.S. at 191.
Second, before asserting a violation of the Just Compensation Clause in federal court, the plaintiff must attempt to obtain compensation through whatever procedures the state has provided for doing so.473 U.S. at 194. The Court stated that here, Tennessee law provides for an inverse condemnation action to seek compensation from the state for a taking of property. Since this qualifies as a "'reasonable, certain and adequate provision for obtaining compensation,"473 U.S. at 194, quoting . Hamilton Bank could not allege a violation of the Just Compensation Clause until it had sought to use this procedure and compensation had been denied.
As for the Bank's Due Process claim, the Court held that since liability for a due process violation would require a finding that the Agency's regulations had the same effect as an outright appropriation of the Bank's property, the effect of the regulations could not be determined because of the lack of a final determination (see above), the due process claim was also found to be unripe.473 U.S. at 200.
Concurring opinions
Justice Brennan filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Marshall, reiterating his dissent in San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. City of San Diego (1981),. in which he presciently argued that the Fifth Amendment requires compensation for temporary regulatory takings.
Justice Stevens wrote a concurring opinion, arguing that the judgment below should be reversed because there was no violation of due process and no formal condemnation of the property.
Dissenting opinions
Justice White dissented from the holding that the takings issue was not ripe for adjudication, without further comment.
 Critical response 
Williamson County's "state procedures" ripeness requirement has proven to be highly controversial. It has been complained that the Court decided this question without adequate briefing,See  the requirement of pursuing compensation from the state is not logically inherent in the text of the Fifth Amendment,See  the rule derives from procedural due process considerations that are inapplicable to takings claims,See Breemer (2006) at 295-97. and that principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel may bar a plaintiff's claim from federal court after complying with Williamson County's procedures to "ripen" the claim. The latter problem became known as the "Williamson Trap" among attorneys for aggrieved property owners,See Meacham (2000) although it was defended as a straightforward application of principles of preclusion by government advocates.See Kovacs (1999); Douglas T. Kendall, et al., Takings Litigation Handbook (2000), pp. 60-75. However, in an earlier landmark takings case, Euclid v. Ambler (1926), the Court held it unnecessary to seek a local permit before challenging a land-use regulation as unconstitutional.
 Subsequent history 
In San Remo Hotel v. City and County of San Francisco (2005),. the Court held that the Full Faith and Credit Statute bars relitigating a Fifth Amendment takings claim in federal court, after just compensation has been denied in state court proceedings. This seemed to bear out the views of commentators who saw Williamson County's second prong as extinguishing federal takings claims, rather than ripening them. Writing for a four-justice concurrence, Chief Justice Rehnquist noted that the impact of the Court's holding could preclude aggrieved property owners from having their federal takings claim considered by any court, and called for the Court to reconsider Williamson County's state procedures requirement "in an appropriate case."545 U.S. at 352.
More recently, the Tennessee Supreme Court noted in a 2010 decision that Tennessee state courts have never held that Article 21 of the Tennessee Constitution requires regulatory takings claims to be compensated in Tennessee state courts; however, the court decided the case on other grounds.
On March 5, 2018, the Court agreed to hear Knick v. Township of Scott, Pennsylvania, which allowed the court to reassess the judicial merits of Williamson County. In their decision issued on June 21, 2019, the Court overturned part of Williamson County related to exhausting state court actions before bringing such action to federal courts.https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-647_m648.pdf

From "Williamson v. Lee Optical Co." ==> """
Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that state laws regulating business are subject to only rational basis review and that the Court need not contemplate all possible reasons for legislation.
Background
The optician plaintiff brought suit to have a 1953 Oklahoma law declared unconstitutional and to enjoin state officials from enforcing it. The law at issue (59 Okla. Stat. Ann. §§ 941–947, Okla. Laws 1953, c. 13, §§ 2–8) contained provisions making it unlawful for any person not a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist to fit lenses to a face or to duplicate or replace into frames lenses or other optical appliances, except upon written prescriptive authority of an Oklahoma licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist. The law required every individual seeking to have eyeglasses made, repaired, or refitted to obtain a prescription. The law had a practical negative effect on unlicensed opticians, but it exempted sellers of ready-to-wear eyeglasses. It was thus challenged on equal protection grounds as well as on due process grounds for arbitrary interference with an optician's right to do business.
The District Court ruled that portions of §§ 2, 3, and 4 of the Act violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution and that portions of § 3 of the Act violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.
Decision
The Court affirmed in part and reversed in part holding, among other things, that the law's provisions did not violate the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It also held that the burdened effect on opticians while sellers of ready-to-wear eyeglasses were exempted did not violate the Equal Protection clause.
Using rational basis review, the Court found that the Oklahoma State Legislature had a legitimate interest in requiring a prescription from a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist. Although opticians were qualified to refit lenses without prescriptions, the Court reasoned that requiring prescriptions in every case would encourage more frequent eye examinations, which may enable early detection of more serious eye conditions. Consequently, if a legitimate governmental interest lies, as reasoned by the Court, the law can survive a Due Process challenge.
The Court further held that there was no Equal Protection violation because legislatures were permitted to deal with problems "one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind." Thus, that opticians were so impacted while sellers of ready-to-wear glasses were exempted may have been a signal that the sellers did not represent a portion of the problem that loomed large in the legislature's mind.
Justice Douglas, writing for the Court, articulated the standard for determining whether the law survives a Due Process challenge: "the law need not be in every respect logically consistent with its aims to be constitutional. It is enough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it."
According to Justice Douglas, "The day is gone when this court uses the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought."
The Court summarily addresses the Equal Protection issue in this case: "The prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause goes no further than invidious discrimination. We cannot say that this point has been reached here.”

From "Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America, Inc." ==> """
Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America, Inc., 562 U.S. 323 (2011), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, in which the Court unanimously held that Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, does not federally preempt state tort lawsuits against auto manufacturers from injuries caused by a defective lack of certain types of seat belts.
The case arose when Thanh Williamson died in a 2002 auto accident from seat-belt related injuries. Williamson's family filed suit against Mazda Motor of America in California state court, claiming a defective design leading to a wrongful death. However, the California trial court dismissed the suit on the pleadings, agreeing with Mazda that the action was preempted by federal law, and the California Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal. The California Supreme Court declined to review the case, but the U.S. Supreme Court accepted the Williamson's petition for certiorari.
In a unanimous decision handed down on February 23, 2011, the Court unanimously (8-0, with Justice Elena Kagan not taking part in this case) reversed the California courts and held that federal preemption does not apply. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the decision of the court. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a concurring opinion, and Justice Clarence Thomas wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment.
 Background 
Dating back as early as 1885, seat belts were first patented by Edward J. Claghorn. In 1955, Ford began offering the lap belt in their automobiles. Saab then began to manufacture their entire range of automobiles with seat belts; most importantly the Saab GT750, launched in 1958. From this model, the practice of seat belt installation then became a competitive advantage to the industry but still did not seem essential to the consumers. Forward, this popular technique became standard in most U.S. automobiles. By 1965, front lap seat belts were produced in several models, by 1968 front shoulder and rear lap belts were introduced, and in 1974 three point front lap belts were adopted in most automobiles. The first United States Federal law pertaining to the use of seat belts became effective January 1, 1968 with the help of the U.S. Department of Transportation which was created two years prior. The law has since been modified but currently requires all vehicles to be produced with three-point seat belts in all seating areas. The use and legality of seat belts varies from state to state, with the first state to pass the law requiring all passengers to wear a seat belt being New York on December 1, 1984. Currently, there are no countries whose automobiles do not offer seat belts and it is a standardized practice worldwide.
During the development of the seat belt, the federal legislation created several agencies responsible for automobile and road safety: The National Traffic Safety Agency, the National Highway Safety Agency, and the National Highway Safety Bureau, which were merged by the 1970 Highway Safety Act into the combined National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The NHTSA was authorized to promulgate regulations - the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) - which provide standards that auto makers must follow in order to allow vehicles  to be imported. Of the 68 FMVSS, two standards, 208 and 209, were implemented to standardize lap and shoulder belts in front seating positions as well as lap belts in all other positions in the vehicle.
Facts of the case 
On the evening of August 14, 2002, the Williamson family driving in their 1993 Mazda MPV minivan, were struck by a Jeep Wrangler from the opposite direction. The Jeep was being towed by a motor home and came loose, crossing over into the Williamson's lane and causing a head-on collision. Delbert Williamson, the petitioner, was driving, while his wife Thanh and daughter Alexa were seated in the first row of seats behind him. Each passenger was wearing the appropriate seat belt per position. Delbert and Alexa were equipped with Type 2 seat belts which consist of lap and shoulder restraints. Thanh, seated in a middle position, was only equipped with a Type 1 seat belt which consists of just a lap belt. As the vehicles collided, Thanh's body was said to "jackknife" over her lap belt, causing internal bleeding and eventual fatal injuries. Delbert and his daughter Alexa both survived the accident because of the type 2 seat belt they were able to use in their seated position.
California state court
The survivors, Delbert and Alexa, brought the tort suit against Mazda in a California state court claiming that the van had a defective design because it was equipped with lap-only seat belts in the back seats, including where Thanh was sitting. Mazda responded with an argument in regards to the 1989 version of FMVSS 208 which preempted any state law tort claims and that the plaintiffs could not argue their product liability claim in court. The company asserted that FMVSS 208 permits manufacturers to install either Type 1 or Type 2 safety restraints in rear aisle seats. They also claimed that a state law permitting attached liability to manufacturers within this standard conflicts with federal laws. Mazda argued that the suit was barred under federal preemption, a doctrine derived from the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution that provides that state law must yield to federal law when the two conflict. On October 22, 2008, the California trial court ruled in favor of Mazda, dismissing the Williamsons' claims.
Williamson appealed the trial court's dismissal of the suit on February 11, 2009, to the California Court of Appeal, but that court affirmed the lower court's decision, relying on Geier v. American Honda Company (2000), in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that the 1984 FMVSS 208 preempted state law claims for car accident injuries due to design. In Williamson's case, the lawsuit also conflicted with Standard 208 and preempted state law claims.
The Williamson petitioned the California Supreme Court to hear the case, but the court declined review.
Supreme Court
Following the California Supreme Court's denial of review, the family petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for certiorari, which was granted on May 24, 2010.
On February 23, 2011, the Court reversed the decision of the California state court by a unanimous 8-0 vote; the Court ruled that FMVSS 208 does not preempt state law claims, distinguishing from the prior decision made in Geier. The opinion of Justice Elena Kagan was found to be extremely persuasive stating that the lower courts had broadly interpreted federal regulations regarding FMVSS 208, but later had no part in the consideration of the case. The reasoning for this decision was based on the fact that automobile manufacturers had the choice to install airbags in the 1984 version of the law. When it came to developing seatbelt standards in the 1989 version of FMVSS 208, there were concerns about the loss of effectiveness. With this concern, the court was able to conclude that there was no basis to demonstrate the intent of preemption in state law claims by federal auto safety standards. The court distinguished this decision from Geier v. American Honda Motor Co. because, unlike in Geier, the state law did not conflict with the federal statute's purposes, as there was no experiment or gradual implementation component in the seatbelt provision. A legal provision for FMVSS 208 was then enacted in September 2007 requiring vehicles to have lap and shoulder belts for all seats in the rear of the vehicle.
 Problems with preemption 
Courts have struggled to define a consistent theory on preemption, and opinions differ on to how and to what extent legislative history ought to be used.

From "Willson v. Black-Bird Creek Marsh Co." ==> """
Willson v. Black-Bird Creek Marsh Co., 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 245 (1829),. was a significant United States Supreme Court case regarding the definition of the Commerce Clause in Article 1 sec. 8, cl. 3 of the U.S. Constitution. 
 Background 
Willson, the owner of a sloop who was licensed under federal navigation laws, the Sally, broke through a dam that blocked his passage which was built by the Black-Bird Creek Marsh Co. and had been authorized to do so by Delaware law. The company brought a case against Willson, claiming Delaware authorized the building of the dam on the Blackbird Creek through a law which was passed under the police power of the state in order to clean up a health hazard and there was no legislation by Congress dealing with the same subject matter. Willson claimed that the law authorizing the building of the dam was a violation of the commerce clause. He believed he had a constitutional right to navigating coastal streams and Delaware's actions were motivated by private profits.
 Opinion 
Chief Justice John Marshall affirmed the lower court's decision, that because no federal law dealt specifically with the situation, and the state law did not violate Congress' Dormant Commerce Clause power, the state law was valid. He did note, however, that the dam might interfere with interstate commerce.Gillman, Graber, and Whittington 2013, p. 223.

From "Wilmington Star Mining Co. v. Fulton" ==> """
Wilmington Star Mining Co. v. Fulton, 205 U.S. 60 (1907), was a case concerning whether it is an appropriate exercise of the police power of the state to regulate the use of mining properties, and that mine owners are not deprived of their property, privileges, or immunities without due process of law, or denied the equal protection of the laws, by the Illinois Mining Statute of 1899, which requires the employment of licensed mine managers and mine examiners and imposes upon the mine owners liability for the willful failure of the manager and examiner to furnish a reasonably safe place for the workmen..
Arguments & rulings
It is within the power of the state to change or modify, in accord with its conceptions of public policy, the principles of the common law in regard to the relation of master and servant, and in cases within the proper scope of the police power, to impose upon the master liability for the willful act of his employee.
As construed by the highest court of that state, under the Mining Act of Illinois of 1899, a mine manager and mine examiner are vice-principals of the owner and engaged in the performance of duties which the owner cannot so delegate to others as to relieve himself from responsibility.
Where two concurring causes contribute to an accident to an employee, the fact that the master is not responsible for one of them does not absolve him from liability for the other cause for which he is responsible.
Where there is no evidence sustaining certain counts in the declaration as to the defendant's negligence, he is entitled to an instruction that no recovery can be had under those counts and where, as it was in this case, the refusal to so instruct is prejudicial error, the verdict cannot be maintained either at law or under § 57 of the Illinois Practice Act.

From "Wilson v. Arkansas" ==> """
Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U.S. 927 (1995), is a United States Supreme Court decision in which the Court held that the traditional, common-law-derived "knock and announce" rule for executing search warrants must be incorporated into the "reasonableness" analysis of whether the actual execution of the warrant is/was justified under the 4th Amendment. The high court thus ruled that the old "knock and announce" rule while not a hard requirement, was also not a dead letter.
Background
Between November and December 1992, Sharlene Wilson, a drug dealer, shared a home with her boyfriend, Bryson Jacobs. During this period of time, an informant working for the Arkansas State Police purchased marijuana and methamphetamine from her. Later, in late November, the same informant contacted Wilson by telephone to arrange a marijuana deal at a local store. According to the informant's testimony, when Wilson showed up to conduct the deal, she waved a semi-automatic pistol in front of her face, threatening to kill her if she found out that she was working  for the authorities. The informant then bought a bag of marijuana and  left.  The next day, acting on information from the informant, police officers applied for search warrants, which stated that Jacobs and Wilson had to be arrested. Affidavits detailed the informant's drug deals and Jacobs' previous convictions of arson and firebombing. In the afternoon, a search was conducted. When police officers approached the property, they had found the door to be unlocked. In the process of opening an unlocked screen door, the officers identified themselves and announced that they had a warrant. Coming inside the house, the officers confiscated marijuana, methamphetamine, Valium, drug paraphernalia, a weapon, and ammunition. When the officers were looking for Wilson and Jacobs, they had found her inside a bathroom, attempting to destroy evidence by flushing marijuana down a toilet. Jacobs and Wilson were arrested and charged with delivery of marijuana, delivery of methamphetamine, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of marijuana.
Trial and State Appeals
During a pre-trial hearing, Wilson filed a motion to suppress against the evidence that was found during the search. She argued  that the search was invalid because the officers did not knock on the door and identify themselves before they entered. This action, according to her, justified excluding the evidence against her. The motion was subsequently denied, and she was convicted of all charges on a jury trial. She received a sentence of 32 years in prison. Her conviction was upheld by the Arkansas Supreme Court, reasoning that,"
 Ms. Wilson submits the officers executing the search failed to knock and announce their identity before entering the residence. The testimony indicated that the officers entered the home while they were identifying themselves. Ms. Wilson relies upon Miller v. United States, 357 U.S. 301, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 2 L.Ed.2d 1332 (1958), as the sole authority for her argument. The appellant contends, based upon Miller, that the Fourth Amendment requires officers to knock and announce prior to entering the residence. However, Miller involved a statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3109, which specified that a law enforcement officer, executing a search warrant, may break open a door only if, "after notice of his authority and purpose," he is denied admittance. The Fourth Amendment was not mentioned.
There is no authority for Ms. Wilson's theory that the knock and announce principle is required by the Fourth Amendment. Furthermore, Ark.R.Crim.P. 13.3 outlines the procedure to be followed in the execution of a search warrant, and provides in part:
(e) The executing officer, and other officers accompanying and assisting him, may use such degree of force, short of deadly force, against persons, or to effect entry or to open containers as is reasonably necessary for the successful execution of the search warrant with all practicable safety.
Rule 13.3 does not contain a "knock and announce" rule. See also Dodson v. State, 4 Ark.App. 1, 626 S.W.2d 624 (1982) (Glaze, J., concurring), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1136, 102 S.Ct. 2966, 73 L.Ed.2d 1355 (1982)."Wilson v. State Decision Text
Opinion of the Supreme Court
In a unanimous (9–0) decision, the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court, finding for Wilson.Oyez article about the case Clarence Thomas authored the majority opinion, arguing that the "knock-and-announce" rule is a part of the reasonableness standard applied while conducting a search, according to the rules of common law":
 The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution protects "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures." In evaluating the scope of this right, we have looked to the traditional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures afforded by the common law at the time of the framing. See California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 624 (1991); United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 418-420 (1976); Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 149 (1925). "Although the underlying command of the Fourth Amendment is always that searches and seizures be reasonable," New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U.S. 325, 337 (1985), our effort to give content to this term may be guided by the meaning ascribed to it by the Framers of the Amendment. An examination of the common law of search and seizure leaves no doubt that the reasonableness of a search of a dwelling may depend in part on whether law enforcement officers announced their presence and authority prior to entering."Full Supreme Court Decision text
Furthermore, the decision was reversed on the grounds that the Arkansas Supreme Court did not sufficiently address the arguments of the State of Arkansas' justifications for the search and arrest of Wilson and Jacobs":
 Respondent contends that the judgment below should be affirmed because the unannounced entry in this case was justified for two reasons. First, respondent argues that police officers reasonably believed that a prior announcement would have placed them in peril, given their knowledge that petitioner had threatened a government informant with a semiautomatic weapon and that Mr. Jacobs had previously been convicted of arson and firebombing. Second, respondent suggests that prior announcement would have produced an unreasonable risk that petitioner would destroy easily disposable narcotics evidence.
These considerations may well provide the necessary justification for the unannounced entry in this case. Because the Arkansas Supreme Court did not address their sufficiency, however, we remand to allow the state courts to make any necessary findings of fact and to make the determination of reasonableness in the first instance."Full Wilson v.

From "Wilson v. Girard" ==> """
Wilson v. Girard, 354 U.S. 524 (1957), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court refused to stop the executive branch from handing United States Army soldier William S. Girard over to Japanese authorities for trial. Girard was accused of killing a Japanese woman while assigned to the U.S. Army in Japan, precipitating a major international incident remembered as the "Girard incident."
Facts
On 30 January 1957, Naka Sakai, a 46-year-old Japanese housewife and mother of six, entered Sōmagahara Air Base in Soma, Gunma Prefecture, for the purpose of collecting spent shell casings to sell as scrap metal. U.S. Army Specialist Third Class William S. Girard, a 21-year-old enlisted man from Ottawa, Illinois, used a grenade launcher mounted on an M1 Garand rifle to fire a spent grenade cartridge at Sakai, which hit her in the back and killed her.Harnisch, Larry. "Soldier kills woman", Los Angeles Times, retrieved November 27, 2007..  Girard then was arrested and held by U.S. authorities,"on or about January 30, 1957, he was arrested and thereafter held in confinement by the military authorities of the United States and is presently held in such confinement . . ."   but Japanese authorities indicted him for criminal homicide."Japan indicted him for causing death by wounding." Wilson, 354 U.S. at 526.  Under the terms of the U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) then in force, both the United States and Japan could claim jurisdiction over his prosecution.  However, the United States' claim had precedence if Girard was "on duty" when the suspected crime occurred.  The United States argued that Girard was in fact "on duty," and that he should therefore be tried by US court martial."The United States claimed the right to try Girard upon the ground that his act, as certified by his commanding officer, was ‘done in the performance of official duty’ and therefore the United States had primary jurisdiction."  Wilson, 354 U.S. at 529. The Japanese government, however, held that Girard's actions had taken place during a period of rest, making him subject to Japanese law. After much discussion, the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration decided that as a matter of political expediency, they would hand Girard over, given that the case was causing great controversy in Japan and threatened to harm the U.S.–Japan Alliance.
Girard sued to stop his surrender to the Japanese.  He petitioned for habeas corpus, claiming he was held unlawfully by the Army.  This was denied by the district court, but the district court did enjoin the Army from handing him over to the Japanese.  Both sides appealed to the Supreme Court.
Decision
The court first noted the principle that a sovereign nation always has exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute crimes in its territory unless it consents to prosecution by some other authority. The court then cited the U.S.–Japan SOFA for the conditions of Japan's consent to U.S. jurisdiction in this case. One of those conditions was that the U.S. could waive its jurisdiction, which it did in this case.Wilson, 354 U.S. at 529. The court then stated that it saw no constitutional problems with such a diplomatic agreement and that the "wisdom" of such agreements are therefore completely within the realm of the political branches.Wilson, 354 U.S. at 530.  The court upheld the district court's denial of habeas corpus and reversed the injunction. That cleared the way for the executive branch to hand Girard over to the Japanese.

From "Wilson v. Mason" ==> """
Wilson v. Mason, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 45 (1801), was a United States Supreme Court case. It resolved a dispute between George Wilson and Founding Father George Mason over  of land along the Green River in present-day Kentucky.
Background
In 1779 the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia enacted a statute that authorized the sale of otherwise unowned land to private buyers.  The act held that anyone who deposits 40 pounds into the state treasury is entitled to  of land West of the Ohio River.  The purchaser would receive a receipt for the amount of land to which he was entitled.  He would then take the receipt to the Land Office and enter a description of the specific land he wanted to claim.  Finally the county surveyor would survey the land according to the description entered into the records of the Land Office and record the survey in the county records.
In April 1780 Mason claimed  in two plats along a tributary of the Green River.  In October of the same year he restated and clarified his claim with the surveyor.  In April 1783 Wilson entered a claim and survey for  which included Mason's  plat.  The survey of Mason's land was conducted in the fall of 1783.  Changes were made to the claim during the survey.  Wilson filed suit to prevent the title to the land they both claimed transferring to Mason.  He claimed that Mason's claim was too vague and that the survey was not conducted properly.
The decision
The essential issue before the court was one of when the claim was properly made.  By the time the Supreme Court heard the case, the land was no longer in Virginia, but was now part of Kentucky.  Also, the statutes at issue were passed by the Virginia Legislature prior to the ratification of the United States Constitution.  Nevertheless, the court felt bound to interpret the law as it was in 1780. The time-line was thus as follows:
 Mason makes claim to land
 Wilson makes claim to land
 Mason surveys land and in so doing may have changed the original claim
The court ruled that it was the claim and not the survey that was dispositive.  Thus, Mason's claim should have been the valid one.  However, the Court concluded that the Mason's survey was performed contrary to the claim.  Therefore, for Mason's title to be valid, the survey and not the claim must be dispositive.
The Court ruled for Wilson and gave him title over the land in question.

From "Wilson v. Omaha Tribe" ==> """
Wilson v. Omaha Tribe, 442 U.S. 653 (1979), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that in a land dispute, 25 U.S.C. § 194. applied only to individuals and not a state, that federal law governed the tribe's right to possession, but that state law was to be used in determining how that applied to the natural movement of a river's boundaries..
Background
In 1854, the Omaha Tribe and the United States entered into a treaty that provided for the tribe to have a reservation in Nebraska, bounded on the east by the center line of the Missouri River.  In 1867, a survey by the Federal General Land Office established the boundaries.  During the intervening years, changes in the river's course occurred. leaving a good deal of land from the survey on the Iowa side of the river.
Non-Indian farmers had also occupied the land in question over those same year. On April 2, 1975, the tribe dispossessed the farmers with the assistance of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the State of Iowa, Wilson, and others filed suits to obtain title to the land in Iowa claimed by the tribe.
District Court
The multiple lawsuits were consolidated into one action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa. The trial court found for the non-Indian defendants, using the state law of Nebraska to determine the issue of the movement of the river, rejecting the position of the United States and the tribe that 25 U.S.C. § 194 controlled the issue.
Circuit Court
The tribe then appealed the trial court's decision to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals court reversed the judgment of the trial court, holding that 25 U.S.C. § 194 did apply. The court stated that once the tribe made a prima facie case, the burden fell on both the non-Indian litigants to prove their case and that the trial court improperly put the burden on the tribe.  The court further held that Federal common law governed, not state law as far as the movement of the river was concerned.
The non-Indians appealed and the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari.
Opinion of the Court
Vacated and remanded. Justice Byron White delivered the opinion of the court.
Justice White stated that first, 25 U.S.C. § 194 did in fact apply to the case as to the individuals and corporations but not to the State of Iowa, and that the defendants had the burden of proof once the tribe established their prima facie case.  He also stated that the Circuit Court was correct that federal law governed, but was in error by arriving at a federal standard that was independent of state law.
Concurring Opinion
Justice Harry Blackmun issued a concurring opinion, in which he discusses the term "white person" in 25 U.S.C. § 194 as being applied to corporations and any non-Indian. He felt that the opinion should have made should have explicitly stated this.

From "Wilson v. Sellers" ==> """
Wilson v. Sellers, 584 U.S. ___ (2018), is a United States Supreme Court case concerning whether a federal court sitting in a habeas corpus proceeding should "look through" a summary ruling to review the last reasoned decision by a state court.
In 1997, a Georgia jury convicted Marion Wilson of murder and sentenced him to death. In December 1999, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed on direct appeal. Wilson next petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in state court.  The petition was denied in a written opinion by the state superior court, which was summarily affirmed by the state supreme court, and denied review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Wilson then filed another petition for habeas corpus, now in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, which was denied.  In December 2014, a unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, also rejecting Wilson's petition. In August 2016, the full en banc Eleventh Circuit again rejected the petition by a vote of 6–5, with Circuit Judge William H. Pryor Jr. writing for the majority and Circuit Judges Adalberto Jordan and Jill A. Pryor writing dissents.
The Court announced judgment in favor of the prisoner on April 17, 2018, reversing and remanding to the lower court by a vote of 6–3. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the Court, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, as well as Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan.  The Court held that the circuit had erred under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 by failing to consider the reasoning in the lower, earlier, written, state court opinion. Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, dissented.
In August 2018, the Eleventh Circuit again denied Wilson's petition, in another opinion by Judge Pryor. Wilson was executed by lethal injection on June 20, 2019.

From "Winona & St. Peter Railroad Co. v. Barney" ==> """
Winona & St. Peter R. Co. v. Barney, 113 U.S. 618 (1885),  was a case in brought to the United States Supreme Court involving public land grants to a state to aid in constructing railroads which contained a description which would be difficult to give full effect if used in an instrument of private conveyance.Winona & St. Peter R. Co. v. Barney, 113 U.S. 618 (1885) Justia.com 
By the Act of March 3, 1857, the United States Congress granted to the then Territory of Minnesota, in aid of the construction of certain railroads, certain alternate sections of lands along the lines of the roads, and further provided:
The reservation of the lands previously granted to Minnesota from the grant of the additional four sections—that is, from the extension of the original grant of 1857—was only a legislative declaration of that which the law would have pronounced independently of it. Previous grants of the same property would necessarily be excluded from subsequent ones. The only embarrassment in the construction of the section arises from the inapt words used to describe the land from which the previous grant is to be deducted. The language of the section is
The only lands granted by the act of 1865 were the four sections for each mile additional to the original six, accompanied with a right to select indemnity lands within twenty miles of the road. The words "the full quantity granted" only denote the entire extension. To the extent of the previous grant that extension must be reduced, even if the whole be taken. Those words did not transfer the loss from the ten sections within which the grant falls to other sections along the line. The sections in which such grant falls are correspondingly reduced.
It followed that where the grant previously made to Minnesota to aid in the construction of the Minnesota and Cedar Valley Railroad interferes with the extension of the grant to the defendant by the act of 1865, the extension must be abandoned. The earlier grant takes the land which would otherwise be added to the original six sections. The court below therefore erred in holding that the Winona and St. Peter Railroad was entitled to ten full sections where such interference occurred, without deducting the lands previously granted to the state. The cause must therefore go back that the proper deduction may be made by reason of this interference of the two grants, and the elder grant be deducted from the extension made by the act of 1865.
The decree was reversed and the cause remanded with directions to take further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

From "United States v. Winstar Corp." ==> """
United States v. Winstar Corp., 518 U.S. 839 (1996), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court which held that the United States Government had breached its contractual obligations. The court in Winstar rejected the Government's "unmistakability defense"—that surrenders of sovereign authority, such as the promise to refrain from regulatory changes, must appear in unmistakable terms in a contract in order to be enforceable..
Winstar arose as a consequence of the savings and loan crisis. Federal regulators had allowed "supervisory goodwill" to be counted as regulatory capital for financial institutions that took over failing thrifts.  Congress later passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, which substantially changed these advantages and one of the successor banks successfully sued. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found a breach of contract and awarded damages—the Supreme Court upheld the lower court decision.  "Winstar" cases resulted in multimillion-dollar payouts to plaintiffs. As of July 31, 2000, there were 13 settlements or judgments totaling $1.158 billion against the federal government, with more than 100 more cases pending, as a result of the Winstar decision.
Winstar Corporation and its subsidiary United Federal Savings Bank was successfully represented by Charles J. Cooper.  The board of United Federal Savings Bank consisted of chairman E. Ted Yoch, and directors Kenneth Bureau, Howard Rekstad, Gary Nordness, and William Bartolic.  The decision makes clear that the Stipulation and Consent to Issuance of Order of Prohibition against United's board was improperly required by the Government.

From "Winston v. Lee" ==> """
Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753 (1985), was a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which held that a compelled surgical intrusion into an individual's body for evidence implicates expectations of privacy and security of such magnitude that the intrusion would be "unreasonable" under the Fourth Amendment, even if likely to produce evidence of a crime.
The reasonableness of surgical intrusions beneath the skin depends on a case-by-case approach, in which the individual's interests in privacy and security are weighed against society's interests in conducting the procedure to obtain evidence for fairly determining guilt or innocence. The appropriate framework of analysis for such cases is provided in Schmerber v. California (1966), which held that a State may, over the suspect's protest, have a physician extract blood from a person suspected of drunken driving without violating the suspect's Fourth Amendment rights.
Background
A shopkeeper, Ralph WatkinsonWinston v. Lee @oyez.org Retrieved November 22, 2020. was wounded by gunshot during an attempted robbery but, also being armed with a gun, apparently wounded his assailant in his left side, and the assailant then ran from the scene. Shortly after Watkinson was taken to a hospital, police officers found Rudolph Lee, who was suffering from a gunshot wound to his left chest area, eight blocks away from the shooting. He was also taken to the hospital, where Watkinson identified him as the robber.
After an investigation, the police charged Lee with, inter alia, attempted robbery, and malicious wounding. Thereafter, the Commonwealth of Virginia moved in state court for an order directing Lee to undergo surgery to remove a bullet lodged under his left collarbone, asserting that the bullet would provide evidence of Lee's guilt or innocence.  However, Lee expressed resistance toward this procedure.  On the basis of expert testimony that the surgery would require an incision of only about one-half inch, could be performed under local anesthesia, and would result in "no danger on the basis that there's no general anesthesia employed," the court granted that the surgery could proceed, and the Virginia Supreme Court denied Lee's petition for a writ of prohibition and/or a writ of habeas corpus.
Lee subsequently brought an action in Federal District Court to prevent the pending operation, claiming that it constituted an "illegal search" on Fourth Amendment grounds, but the court refused to issue a preliminary injunction. Shortly thereafter, X-rays taken just before surgery was scheduled to begin showed that the bullet was lodged substantially deeper than had been thought when the state court initially granted the motion to compel surgery, and the surgeon concluded that a general anesthetic would be desirable. Armed with this information, Lee unsuccessfully sought a rehearing in the state trial court, and the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed. However, Lee then returned to the Federal District Court, which, after an evidentiary hearing, ruled against enforcing the surgery, a ruling which the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Opinion of the Court
The Supreme Court, was unanimous in determining that, in the absence of any potentially substantial evidentiary gains from performing such an operation, the surgery did indeed constitute an "unreasonable search" under the Fourth Amendment.  According to the opinion authored by William J. Brennan Jr., since the Commonwealth of Virginia could not produce a compelling argument that recovering the bullet from Lee would provide significant evidence in the case, the surgery was unconstitutional.  However, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote in his concurring opinion that this motion did not necessarily preclude officers from detaining an individual whose body/presence could naturally provide evidence in a case.

From "Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council" ==> """
Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court concerning whether federal law restricted the United States Navy's ability to use sonar during drills given the possibility of a harmful effect on marine mammals such as whales.. 
In balancing military preparedness against environmental concerns, the majority came down solidly on the side of national security. Chief Justice Roberts wrote in his opinion, “the most serious possible injury would be harm to an unknown number of marine mammals that they study and observe”. By contrast, he continued, “forcing the Navy to deploy an inadequately trained antisubmarine force jeopardizes the safety of the fleet”.
Background and procedural history
The U.S. Navy had scheduled 14 training exercises through January 2009 off the coast of Southern California involving the use of “mid-frequency active sonar” to detect enemy submarines. Environmentalists argued that the sonar's high decibel levels may have a deafening effect on whales. They said studies conducted around the world have shown the piercing underwater sounds cause whales to flee in panic or to dive too deeply. Whales have been found beached in Greece, the Canary Islands, and in the Bahamas after sonar was used in the area, and necropsies showed signs of internal bleeding near the ears. 
In February 2007, however, the U.S. Navy published an environmental impact assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) that found that the use of mid-frequency active sonar would cause minimal harm to marine mammals. The Navy, represented by Solicitor General Gregory G. Garre, "highlight[ed] that there was an 'absence' of injury to marine mammals in Southern California despite forty years of Navy training in the area".
The petitioners were mostly environmental groups, including Natural Resources Defense Council and Jean-Michel Cousteau's Ocean Futures Society, among others. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the exercises on the ground that they violated NEPA and other environmental laws. 
The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California granted a preliminary injunction barring conduct of the exercises. On remand from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the district court modified the preliminary injunction to allow the Navy to use sonar if it used mitigation measures. On the Navy’s second appeal, challenging two of the mitigation measures, the Ninth Circuit—"widely regarded as an environmentally friendly"—affirmed the modified injunction, noting that the plaintiffs (petitioners in the Supreme Court) had carried their burden of showing a “possibility” of irreparable injury and that the balance of hardships weighed in favor of plaintiffs.
Opinion of the court
The majority opinion held that as an initial matter the Ninth Circuit’s "possibility" test for issuance of a preliminary injunction is too lenient; plaintiffs must show that irreparable injury is "likely" in the absence of an injunction. However, the Court continued, even if plaintiffs had shown irreparable injury (and, too, likelihood of success on the merits), it is "plainly outweighed" by the Navy’s interest in effective, realistic training of its sailors. That factor alone requires denial of the requested injunctive relief. For the plaintiffs, the most serious possible injury would be the loss of ability to observe an unknown number of marine mammals. In light of the foregoing, the Court reversed the decision below and vacated the preliminary injunction. The Court technically did not address the merits of the lawsuit—that is, whether the training exercises had violated NEPA or the other federal environmental laws.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justice David Souter, wrote a dissenting opinion which sided with the Ninth Circuit. She found that despite the importance of the U.S. Navy’s training exercises, they did not outweigh the considerations of environmental harm mandated by NEPA.
Comments
A report published in 2009 by the Congressional Research Service noted that the Supreme Court accepted the case "as a challenge to a preliminary injunction, rather than to the merits of petitioners’ statutory claims". However, the report observed that "the Court made clear, however, that its perception of an overriding national security interest in the challenged training exercises should lead the district court to reject a final injunction as well, in the event the military is found to have violated an environmental statute".
This was the first time the United States successfully got the judiciary to reject the Ninth Circuit’s “mere possibility” test for issuing injunctions.
Other commentators called it "a dangerous precedent" and "a troubling example of unquestioned deference to an invocation of military necessity at the expense of the environment" and said that it "signal[ed] a marked shift from lower courts’ treatment of NEPA injunctions, raising questions about the availability of restraining orders for NEPA violations in the future".

From "Winters v. United States" ==> """
Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564 (1908), was a United States Supreme Court case clarifying water rights of American Indian reservations.Duthu, N. (2008). "American Indians and the Law", p. 105.Penguin Group Inc., New York. . This doctrine was meant to clearly define the water rights of indigenous people in cases where the rights were not clear.Waldman, C. (2009). "Atlas of the North American Indian", p. 241.Checkmark Books.. The case was first argued on October 24, 1907, and a decision was reached January 6, 1908.Brewer, Justice. "Winters vs. United States". Retrieved on 2009-9-14 This case set the standards for the United States government to acknowledge the vitality of indigenous water rights, and how rights to the water relate to the continuing survival and self-sufficiency of indigenous people.Thorson, John. (2006). "Tribal Water Rights", p. 35-36.University of Arizona Press..
Background
Water rights
thumb|left|Water rights for indigenous peoples go much further than the water itself, as the rights also control where they are allowed to fish.
Water rights are extremely important to Indigenous peoples, especially those tribes living in the West, where water supplies are limited. Reservations, and those who live within them, rely on water sources for the water necessary for them to be self-sufficient. Reservations rely on streams and rivers for agricultural purposes. Not only is the water itself important to the Reservations, but also what the water contains. By having the rights to an area of water, one also gains rights to what is in the water.  This gives an implied right to fish the waters.  Because life relies on water, it may be fair to say that whoever controls the water ultimately has control over life on the reservation.American Indian Law Review, Vol. 7, No. 1 (1979), pp. 155-169 Published by: University of Oklahoma College of Law
Riparian system
The Riparian water system is the system controlling water use in the eastern states where water is found to be more plentiful. Under this system the owner of the land bordering the source of water is entitled to use of said water.Canby, William. (2004). "American Indian Law", p. 426.Thomson West.. This system is sufficient for the states where water is found in abundance, but in the less water-rich western states the control of water must be handled differently.
Appropriative system
In the western part of the country, water ownership is controlled by the appropriative system. This system states that the owner of a piece of land does not automatically own the rights to water found on that land. Rights to water belong to the first user who puts the water to beneficial use. The first people to become appropriators of the water source have the right to continue using the water in the same quantity as always as long as they continue putting the water to good use. This holds true no matter how many other people wish to use the water. The latest water appropriator loses all of their water rights before any water rights are taken from the next latest appropriator.Canby, William. (2004). "American Indian Law", p. 427.Thomson West.. The Fort Belknap Reservation in Montana, which had been created by the government in 1888, experienced issues with the appropriative water system when water flow to their reservation was being diverted to settlements of non American Indians.Canby, William. (2004). "American Indian Law", p. 429.Thomson West..
Fort Belknap American Indian Reservation
The Fort Belknap Indian Reservation was created in 1888 in Montana. It was created from what had once been a much larger area of land to be set aside for tribes. The 1888 agreement neglected to mention any water rights that were reserved for the reservation in relation to the Milk River. Soon there came a huge demand for water by settlers which was an issue for the Fort Belknap American Indian reservation.Shurts, John. (2000). "Indian Reserved Water Rights", p. 15.University of Oklahoma Press. . As non-Indian settlers began moving closer to the Fort Belknap Reservation, the settlers claimed rights to the water. The settlers did things such as building dams and reservoirs which prevented the reservation from receiving water needed for agricultural purposes. The settlers used the terms of the appropriative water system to support their actions, claiming that they had appropriated the water before the Natives living on the reservation had put the water to beneficial use.
Decision
The United States Supreme Court case of Winters v. United States held that the decree enjoining the companies from utilizing river waters intended for a Reservation was affirmed. It was also held that when reservations were created by the United States government, they were created with the intention of allowing indigenous settlements to become self-reliant and self-sufficient. As reservations require water to become self-sufficient in areas such as agriculture, it was found that water rights were reserved for tribes as an implication of the treaties that created the reservations.Thorson, John. (2006). "Tribal Water Rights", p. 204.University of Arizona Press..
Majority opinion
thumb|left|Associate Justice Joseph McKenna delivered the majority opinion.
The Supreme Court came to the decision that the Fort Belknap reservation had reserved water rights through the 1888 agreement which created the Fort Belknap American Reservation. It was found unnecessary for the natives to have to reserve the water rights if they had already reserved the rights to the land for agricultural purposes because the natives would have no use for the farmland if they could not have access to a water source. It was decided that the water rights of the Milk River were implied when the Fort Belknap Reservation was created in order to uphold provisions that had been previously stated. The majority opinion was delivered to the United States Supreme Court by associate justice, Joseph McKenna. McKenna wrote that five of the defendants named in the bill failed to answer. He wrote that the other defendants who did answer filed a joint and several answer. From this answer, the case was heard and a decree was entered against all of the defendants. It was determined by the Supreme Court that the reasoning behind the establishment of reservations was to provide a permanent homeland for the natives. The majority opinion found that the decree held.Find Law. "WINTERS v. U. S., 207 U.S. 564 (1908)" Retrieved on 2009-10-14. The majority opinion was held by Chief Justice Melville W. Fuller and Associate Justices William R. Day, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Joseph McKenna, William H. Moody, Rufus Wheeler Peckham, and Edward D. White.Winters v. United States., 207 U.S. 564 (1908). After the verdict had been reached, the United States government allocated $25,000 to be used for the purpose of extending the irrigation system on the Milk River for use by the Fort Belknap American reservation.Cortelyou, Geo B. Secretary of the Treasury. "Letter From Secretary of Treasury to the House of Representatives" Retrieved on 2009-10-14.
Dissenting opinion
Associate justice David J. Brewer dissented from the majority opinion.
Implications
The Winters court reasoned that water rights were implied in the agreement that had been made with the natives in 1888, when the reservation was created. This agreement stated that the Fort Belknap Reservation had been created with the intention of the tribal people being able to become self-sufficient. The court noted that land without water has no value, especially when the purpose of a land was to help a group become self-supporting in the way of agriculture. Therefore, a reservation of water goes along with the reservation of the land. Water rights may be implied from reservations made by presidential executive order, or reservations which are created by an act of Congress.Bureau of Land Management. "Federal Reserved Water Rights". Retrieved on 2009-10-13 Other implications of this court case include setting more of a standard for indigenous water rights along with setting a precedent for later Supreme Court cases which deal with implied water rights.
Winters rights
Winters rights refers to the reserved water rights cases that followed Winters.Canby, William. (2004). American Indian Law, p. 431. Thomson West. .
 First, that they are defined by the federal government and federal law controls them.Thorson, John. (2006). Tribal Water Right, p. 78-79. University of Arizona Press. .
 Second, when reservations were established by either a treaty, statute, or executive order, and water rights were not specifically mentioned, a reservation of water rights was implied. These water rights apply to water sources that are either within the reservation or bordering it.
 Third, then states that the water rights are reserved as soon as the portion of the reservation cases where competing users of the water source have prior appropriation dates of said water source, they will take precedence over the indigenous rights. Only those with prior appropriation dates take precedence, those with later dates are subordinate to the reservation in question. In most cases, it is found that tribes do in general have senior priority dates for quantities of surface water than competing settlements.
The amount of water reserved for the use of tribes is equal to the amount of water that would sufficiently irrigate all of the irrigable acreage within the reservation. In some cases this part of the Winters rights is extended to include water used not just for agricultural purposes, but for all purposes. For example, a Bureau of Indian Affairs document breaks down what the BIA believes to be the estimated water requirements of all different reservations, including the Fort Belknap Reservation in Montana. This document states that the Fort Belknap reservation will need water for uses such as recreation, wildlife, forestry, energy, minerals, industrial use, domestic use, and agricultural use. These uses are listed in ascending order of the amount of water estimated to be required.Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of Interior, 1978, Report No. 262.
It is also said that Winters rights are not lost by an reservation's lack of use of the water; the rights apply even if the reservation is not using their full portion of water.Canby, William. (2004). American Indian Law, p. 433. Thomson West. .
Effects following ruling
Although the ruling of Winters v. United States was made very clear, accounts show that water rights relating to reservations were put aside and neglected for decades after the ruling. While the United States government was caught up in the emergence of non-native settlers moving west, the government seemed to turn a blind eye to many non-native settlers who were making use of water sources which, under the terms of Winters v. United States, had been reserved for reservation use. The United States Supreme Court was not called upon to further define reserved water rights until the case of Arizona v. California in 1963.
Related cases
Winters v. United States was a United States Supreme Court Case with many implications. One thing that makes this case so monumental is the precedent that is set by it for United States Supreme Court cases that would follow it.
Arizona v. California
Arizona v. California was a set of 11 United States Supreme Court cases dealing with water rights."American Indian Law Review." LexisNexis. 13 October  2009. These cases took place between the years of 1931 and 2006. The initial question of this case was to determine how much water from the Colorado river Arizona was entitled to. Many western states became involved in the debate over the rights of the water from the Colorado River, and finally the United States government became involved stating that several federal establishments, including five reservations, had water rights as defined by Winters v. United States."STATE OF ARIZONA v. STATE OF CALIFORNIA, ET AL." LexisNexis. 13 October  2009. This United States Supreme Court case helped to solve a problem found in the case Winters v. United States. While the United States Supreme Court case of Winters v. United States held that Reservations do have reserved water rights equal to the amount of water needed on the reservation to sufficiently irrigate all of the irrigable reservation acreage, there was always the question of how to decide what amount of water was needed to sufficiently irrigate on the reservations. Arizona v. California offers the solution of adjudication to help fix this problem.Canby, William. (2004). "American Indian Law", p. 437.Thomson West..
Arizona v. San Carlos Apache Tribe of Arizona
This case dealt with either the United States as trustee or certain tribes asserting their rights to have certain water rights in Arizona or Montana determined in federal court. The court ruled that all limits that any federal legislation put on state-court jurisdiction over indigenous water rights were removed by the McCarran Amendment. This piece of legislation allowed state courts jurisdiction to determine indigenous water rights. This ruling included suits brought by tribes and pertaining to only indigenous claims. The decision of this case was that the judgment in each of the cases was reversed, and the cases were to be reviewed further."ARIZONA ET AL. v. SAN CARLOS APACHE TRIBE OF ARIZONA ET AL." LexisNexis. 13 October  2009.
Nevada v. United States
This United States Supreme Court case centered around water rights involving the Truckee River. The defendants in the case were all people who used water from the Truckee River, while the plaintiff was the United States. The defendants argued against tribal use of the water in the Truckee River stating that the American tribes were not parties to the original cause of action between the United States and the non-indigenous users of the water. The court ruled that the tribes did have water rights and were allowed to make use of the water in the Truckee River."NEVADA v. UNITED STATES ET AL." LexisNexis. 13 October  2009.
United States v. New Mexico
The United States claimed to have reserved the use of water out of the Rio Mimbres stream only where necessary to preserve the environment and wildlife. For instance, to care for the timber in the forest or to secure favorable water flows. The United States Supreme Court upheld the ruling made earlier by the Supreme Court of New Mexico. This ruling stated that the United States did not have reserved rights in the Rio Mimbres stream when it came to recreational purposes."UNITED STATES v. NEW MEXICO." LexisNexis. 13 October  2009.
Cappaert v. United States
Devils Hole cavern in Nevada became a detached part of Death Valley National Monument in 1952, by a proclamation of President Harry S. Truman made under the Antiquities Act. The cavern is home to a rare species of desert fish, the Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis). In 1968 the Cappaerts, who were ranchers, were granted an application by the Nevada state engineer to begin using a water supply which took water from Devil's Hole cavern, which lowered water levels in the cavern and endangered the viability of the fish. The federal government sought to place limits on the Cappaerts' use of the water, so as to protect the fish from extinction.Cappaert v. United States, 426 U.S. 128 (1976).
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the United States. The Court held that the implied-reservation-of-water-rights doctrine applies to groundwater as well as surface water. The Court next reaffirmed that "Federal water rights are not dependent upon state law or state procedures and they need not be adjudicated only in state courts." Finally, the Court held that when the United States had reserved Devil's Hole in 1952, "it acquired by reservation water rights in unappropriated appurtenant water sufficient to maintain the level of the pool to preserve its scientific value" (i.e., preserve the fish, which are "objects of historic or scientific interest" under the American Antiquities Preservation Act).
Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States
The United States Supreme Court case Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States concerned the abstention doctrine which helped to prevent duplicate litigation between state courts and federal courts."COLORADO RIVER WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICT ET AL. v. UNITED STATES." LexisNexis. 13 October  2009.
United States v. Powers
This United States Supreme Court case occurred over the argument of tribal water rights, and whether or not the water rights are passed along with the tribal land. When reservations would sell allotments of land to non-tribe members, those to whom the land was sold would want the same proportion of the reservation's water that the previous indigenous land owner had received. The Supreme Court upheld the earlier ruling that water rights are passed along with the land, meaning that a person who purchases land from an reservation also purchases an allotment of the water source used on the reservation."UNITED STATES v. POWERS ET AL." LexisNexis. 13 October  2009.

From "Wisconsin Department of Revenue v. William Wrigley Jr. Co." ==> """
Wisconsin Department of Revenue v. William Wrigley Jr. Co., 505 U.S. 214 (1992), is a case decided by the United States Supreme Court regarding the application of state franchise taxes to out-of-state businesses.
Background
In 1980, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (WDR) decided that the in-state activities of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company in selling and supplying retailers with chewing gum exceeded limits defined by Congress in 1961 that exempted foreign corporations from franchise and income taxes in a state as long as their activities were limited to soliciting customers. Wrigley, based in Chicago, neither owned nor leased any real property in the state. Its employees were limited to a regional sales manager, who worked out of his house, and district sales representatives who dealt directly with retailers. The company provided the representatives with cars and reimbursed some of their expenses. Nevertheless, WDR believed that since the sales reps also stored gum and personally resupplied retailers, including replacement of stale gum stocks at no cost, the company did more than just solicit customers in Wisconsin.
Wrigley felt that it was exempt from Wisconsin taxation under the Interstate Income Act of 1959 ( et seq.), which provides that "states cannot impose a 'net income tax' on 'any person' if the only contact with a state is limited to the solicitation of orders for sales of tangible personal property". A "legal person" can be an individual or a corporate body.
Wisconsin calls for taxation
Wisconsin believed that the presence of Wrigley in the state was enough to call for a franchise tax. The state believed that Wrigley was not afforded protection under Public Law 86-272, because it violated solicitation by the following practices:
Recruitment, training, and evaluation of sales employees by regional manager
Intervention in credit disputes by regional manager
Use of hotel rooms and homes for sales meetings
Replacement of stale gum at no cost to retailer
"Agency stock checks" — billing of retailer for gum supplied from in-state inventory to fill display racks
Storage of gum in sales representatives' homes or in rented space
View of litigants
The state argued for the narrowest possible view: that any activity beyond “asking the customer to purchase the product” removed the protection of P.L.86-272. It also argued that activities leading up to the sale may be protected, but any activities taking place after the sale are more than solicitation.
Wrigley argued for a broad interpretation: that “solicitation” should encompass all ordinary business activities that generally accompany the solicitation process. According to Wrigley, all activities normally assigned to sales reps should be considered solicitation.
Result
The Court found that Wrigley’s activities in Wisconsin exceeded the provisions of the state code and allowed the imposition of the tax.. The Court ruled that the replacement of stale gum, "agency stock checks", and maintenance of inventory for those purposes were not protected, and the Court sided with the Wisconsin Department of Revenue.

Wisconsin v. City of New York, 517 U.S. 1 (1996), was a United States Supreme Court case that held that under the Constitution's Census Clause, Congress is granted with the authority to conduct an "actual enumeration" of the American society, chiefly for the purpose of allocating congressional representation among the states.
Congress assigned the responsibility of conducting an "actual enumeration" of the American society to the Secretary of Commerce, who in the 1990 census, decided not to implement the statistical correction, better known as the post-enumeration survey (PES) to adjust an undercount in the initial population count.
Furthermore, following several citizens' groups, states, and cities, Wisconsin disputed the Secretary's decision not to use PES declaring that it resulted in an undercounting of certain identifiable minority groups.

From "Wisconsin v. Illinois" ==> """
Wisconsin v. Illinois, 278 U.S. 367 (1929), also referred to as the Chicago Sanitary District Case, is an opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States which held that the equitable power of the United States can be used to impose positive action on one state in a situation in which nonaction would result in damage to the interests of other states..  Pursuant to Article Three of the United States Constitution, the case was heard under the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction (i.e. it did not come to the Supreme Court from a lower court) because it involved a controversy between two states, Illinois and Wisconsin). Chief Justice William Howard Taft wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court.
The case
The city of Chicago increasingly was diverting Great Lakes waters to carry off sewage through a long-established drainage canal, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. Illinois claimed that these increasing amounts of diverted water were made necessary by Chicago's growth.  Wisconsin, however, claimed that the diversion was lowering lake levels, thereby impairing its transportation facilities and abilities. 
After exhaustive hearings, a special master was assigned by the Supreme Court of the United States to consider the facts of the case fixed maximum diversion at a point below that necessary for continued utilization of the drainage canal system alone, thereby requiring the construction of sewage disposal works, but the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois procrastinated. The State of Illinois excepted to the special master's findings, and the Supreme Court heard the case en banc over two days in April 1928.  
Chief Justice Taft's opinion for the Court finally settled the question of the authority of the United States to intervene to enforce action by a state in such a situation. He wrote, "In deciding the controversy between States, the authority of the Court to enjoin the continued perpetration of the wrong inflicted on the complainants, necessarily embraces the authority to require measures to be taken to end the conditions, within the control of the defendant state, which may stand in the way of the execution of the decree." This quote is not from the actual opinion of the case.
The Court entered its decree shortly thereafter..

Two Supreme Court cases, Wisconsin v. Michigan, 295 U.S. 455 (1935) and Wisconsin v. Michigan, 297 U.S. 547 (1936), settled a territorial dispute between Wisconsin and Michigan.
 Background  
The 1836 boundary description between Wisconsin and Michigan described the line through northwest Lake Michigan as "the most usual ship channel".  This description needed clarification as two routes were in use into Green Bay. Multiple islands lay in between and all were claimed as part of both Door County, Wisconsin, and Delta County, Michigan. A similar case, Michigan v. Wisconsin 270 U.S. 295 (1926), had previously been brought to the Supreme Court but was dismissed.
 Decision 
In 1936, the Supreme Court decision chose the ship channel through the Rock Island Passage as the more common, so Wisconsin retained the intervening water area with its islands: Plum, Detroit, Washington, Hog, and Rock.

From "Wisconsin v. Mitchell" ==> """
Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S. 476 (1993), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that enhanced penalties for hate crimes do not violate criminal defendants' First Amendment rights.. It was a landmark precedent pertaining to First Amendment free speech arguments for hate crime legislation.Tina M. Fielding Fryling,  10 (2014). In effect, the Court ruled that a state may consider whether a crime was committed or initially considered due to an intended victim's status in a protected class.Thomas D. Brooks, First Amendment--Penalty Enhancement for Hate Crimes: Content Regulation, Questionable State Interests and Non-Traditional Sentencing, 84  703, 703 (1994).
Background facts
The respondent, Todd Mitchell, was with a group of other African American individuals, in an apartment complex in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Members of this group were discussing the film Mississippi Burning; in particular, a scene in which a white man beat a young black boy who was praying. According to the facts, undisputed by the respondent, in the briefs filed in lower courts, the group had discussed the scene indoors while drinking, and later moved outside the apartment complex. Outside, they were joined by Mitchell and further discussed the scene. Seeing that everyone is enraged, Mitchell asked the group, "Do you all feel hyped up to move on some white peoples?"
Looking across the street, Mitchell and the group spot Gregory Reddick, a white fourteen-year old, walking home from a nearby pizza parlor. Mitchell reportedly turned to the group and remarked, "You all want to fuck somebody up? There goes a white boy; go get him." Mitchell counted to three and then pointed left and right, signaling that they should encircle him. Ten of them then took off after Reddick, most running directly at him. One person in the group kicked Reddick, knocking him to the ground. Several attackers then surrounded Reddick. They kicked, punched, and stomped on him for over five minutes. The beating left Reddick unconscious on the ground, and one of the attackers remarked that they had killed him. Another then, took Reddick's British Knights sneakers and showed them off later at his apartment complex with Mitchell. The police found Reddick unconscious a short while later. He remained in a coma for four days in the hospital; the record indicates he fully recovered from all physical injuries.
Trial and state-level appeals
In a jury trial, under the Circuit Court for Kenosha County, Mitchell was convicted of aggravated battery. The maximum sentence was raised to seven years imprisonment because Mitchell had selected his target based on race. This was pursuant to a Wisconsin statute (939.645) that allowed for such an increase if it could be shown that the defendant, "[i]intentionally selects the person against whom the crime... is committed... because of the race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry of that person...." The Circuit Court sentenced Mitchell to four years imprisonment.
Mitchell appealed the decision of the Wisconsin Circuit Court, alleging that the Wisconsin statute unconstitutionally infringed upon his First Amendment rights. The appeal was rejected by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed this, arguing that the statute was a direct violation of the First Amendment, because it "punish[ed] what the legislature has deemed to be offensive thought." It rejected the State of Wisconsin's claim, that the statute only punished the "conduct" in which a victim was selected, saying that it felt the law punishes the reason the defendant selected the victim. This was an important distinction to make in constitutional law, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court invoked the United States Supreme Court's ruling in R.A.V. v. St. Paul, claiming this law criminalized, "bigoted thought with which it disagrees."
Further, the Wisconsin Supreme Court claimed that the law was also unconstitutionally over broad, reasoning that, in order to prove a person selected a victim in the prohibited manner, the state would need to introduce evidence of a person's prior speech. The court thought this would create a "chilling effect" on free speech in general, as people sought to avoid the appearance of bigotry in fear that it may be used against them in court at a later time to enhance their potential penalty. The court distinguished their opinion on this matter from anti discrimination laws, which had already been ruled constitutional, claiming that the law in question for this particular case, punished the "subjective mental process" of victim selection, whereas the anti discrimination laws upheld previously had punished "objective acts of discrimination."
The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari.
Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
Writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice William Rehnquist reasoned 
that, in substance, Wisconsin's law served the same purpose as federal antidiscrimination law. Whereas, in R.A.V., the ordinance struck down was explicitly targeted at expression, the statute in this case was directed towards conduct that was not expressive as such, but was instead directed at violence in particular.
The Court further stated that, Wisconsin was within its rights to offer sentence enhancement in bias-motivated crime because it had a compelling interest in preventing the negative secondary effects of such crimes. Among these secondary effects mentioned were the increased likelihood of a bias-motivated crime to provoke retaliation, to inflict greater emotional distress on the victim, and to incite community unrest. The Court explained that, these secondary effects were more than adequate reason for such a sentencing enhancement, especially if, as stated above, the law was not explicitly targeting beliefs or statements.
Regarding the "chilling effect" argument presented by Mitchell's side, the Court stated that it "[found] no merit in this contention." The Court determined that, this rationale was far too speculative in nature to merit a genuine complaint of a statute's constitutional over breadth. Because lesser crimes such as "negligent operation of a motor vehicle" (cited in the opinion) were very unlikely to ever be racially-based, the Court stated that for this statute to be over broad one would have to consider the prospect of a citizen actively suppressing their bigoted beliefs because they believed they could be used against him, or her at a trial for a serious offense, such as burglary, battery, or murder.
Finally, the Court noted that it is relatively commonplace for a defendant's prior speech to be presented to the court as evidence. This is a tool in the judicial process, often serving a vital role in establishing the defendant's motive.
For the reasons listed above, the Court reversed the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision, and remanded the case to a lower court for final proceedings.

From "Wisconsin v. Yoder" ==> """
Wisconsin v. Jonas Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972), is the case in which the United States Supreme Court found that Amish children could not be placed under compulsory education past 8th grade.  The parents' fundamental right to freedom of religion was determined to outweigh the state's interest in educating their children. The case is often cited as a basis for parents' right to educate their children outside of traditional private or public schools.
Background of the case
Three Amish students from three different families stopped attending the New Glarus High School in the New Glarus, Wisconsin, school district at the end of the eighth grade because of their parent's religious beliefs.  The three families were represented by Jonas Yoder (one of the fathers involved in the case) when the case went to trial.  They were convicted in the Green County Court. Each defendant was fined the nominal sum of $5. Thereafter the Wisconsin Supreme Court found in Yoder's favor. Thereupon, Wisconsin appealed that ruling in the US Supreme Court.
The Amish did not believe in going to court to settle disputes but instead follow the biblical command to "turn the other cheek."   Thus, the Amish are at a disadvantage when it comes to defending themselves in courts or before legislative committees.  However, a Lutheran minister, Reverend William C. Lindholm, took an interest in Amish legal difficulties from a religious freedom perspective and founded The National Committee for Amish Religious Freedom (partly as a result of this case) and then provided them with legal counsel.
Under Amish church standards, higher education was deemed not only unnecessary for their simple way of life, but also endangering to their salvation.  These men appealed for exemption from compulsory education on the basis of these religious convictions.  They sincerely held to the belief that the values their children would learn at home would surpass the worldly knowledge taught in school.
Court's decision
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Yoder in its decision. Justice William O. Douglas filed a partial dissent, but voted with the court regarding Yoder's case. Justices Lewis F. Powell, Jr. and William H. Rehnquist took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court "sustained respondents' claim that application of the compulsory school-attendance law to them violated their rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment."
The U.S. Supreme Court held as follows:
 States cannot force individuals to attend school when it infringes on their First Amendment rights. In this case, the state of Wisconsin interfered with the practice of a legitimate religious belief.
 Not all beliefs rise to the demands of the religious clause of the First Amendment. There needs to be evidence of true and objective religious practices, instead of an individual making his or her standards on such matters. The Amish way of life is one of deep religious convictions that stems from the Bible. It is determined by their religion, which involves their rejection of worldly goods and their living in the Biblical simplicity. The modern compulsory secondary education is in sharp conflict with their way of life.
 With respect to the State of Wisconsin's argument that additional modern education beyond 8th grade is necessary to prepare citizens to participate effectively and productively in America's political system, the Court disagreed. It argued that the State provided no evidence showing any great benefit to having two extra years in the public schools. Furthermore, the Court contended that the Amish community was a very successful social unit in American society, a self-sufficient, law-abiding member of society, which paid all of the required taxes and rejected any type of public welfare. The Amish children, upon leaving the public school system, continued their education in the form of vocational training.
 The Court found no evidence that by leaving the Amish community without two additional years of schooling, young Amish children would become burdens on society. To the contrary, the Court argued that they had good vocational background to rely upon. It was the State's mistaken assumption that Amish children were ignorant. Compulsory education after elementary school was a recent movement that developed in the early 20th century in order to prevent child labor and keep children of certain ages in school. The State of Wisconsin's arguments about compelling the school attendance were therefore less substantial.
 Responding to Justice Douglas's dissent, the Court argued that the question before it was about the interests of the parents to exercise free religion, and did not relate to the child's First Amendment's rights. As such, the argument pertaining to the child's right to exercise free religion was irrelevant in this case.
Justice Potter Stewart, joined by Justice William J. Brennan,  Jr., filed a concurring opinion stating that the 'interesting and important' questions raised by Justice Douglas' dissent were moot since the Amish children shared their parents' religious objections to the school attendance. 
Justice Byron White, joined by Justices Brennan and Stewart, filed a concurring opinion saying the case 'would be a very different case' if the parents forbade their children from 'attending any school at any time and from complying in any way with the educational standards set by the State'; he pointed out that the burden on the children was relatively slight since they had acquired 'the basic tools of literacy to survive in modern society' and had attended eight grades of school.
Dissenting opinion
Justice William O. Douglas, who dissented in part, wrote:
Legacy of the Court's decision
The ruling is cited as a basis for allowing people to be educated outside traditional private or public schools, such as with homeschooling.
The implications of the case for the Amish were characterized by one author as:
Since Wisconsin v. Yoder,  all states must grant the Old Order Amish the right to establish their own schools (should they choose) or to withdraw from public institutions after completing eighth grade. In some communities Amish parents have continued to send their children to public elementary schools even after Wisconsin v. Yoder.  In most places tensions eased considerably after the Supreme Court ruling, although certain difficulties remained for those Amish living in Nebraska.

From "Witherspoon v. Illinois" ==> """
Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968), was a U.S. Supreme Court case where the court ruled that a state statute providing the state unlimited challenge for cause of jurors who might have any objection to the death penalty gave too much bias in favor of the prosecution.
The Court said,
The decision in this case would cause the Supreme Court of California to order a retrial on the penalty phase in the 1972 case of California v. Anderson, and when the case was heard for the third time, would find the imposition of the death penalty was unconstitutional on the grounds of the penalty being cruel or unusual punishment, in violation of the State Constitution.  The decision would become national in scale when the U.S. Supreme Court also in 1972 ruled in Furman v. Georgia that all death penalty cases were in violation of the 8th Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.
Death
Witherspoon died at his home in Detroit, Michigan on Sunday March 4, 1990 after a battle with cancer.

From "Wainwright v. Witt" ==> """
Wainwright vs. Witt, 469 U.S. 412 (1985), was a U.S. Supreme Court case concerning a criminal defendant, Johnny Paul Witt, who argued that his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated when he was sentenced to death for first degree murder by the state of Florida. He argued that the trial court had unconstitutionally hand-picked a jury during the voir dire process.Witt v. Wainwright, . This was because certain people were excused from the jury because they admitted pre-trial, that their decision of guilty or not guilty toward capital punishment would be swayed due to personal or religious beliefs.Wainwright v. Witt, .
Background
Facts
In 1974, the defendant, Johnny Paul Witt, was tried and convicted of first degree murder in the state of Florida. It was proven that the murder had taken place while the defendant and his accomplice Gary Tillman were bow and arrow hunting in the woods. The two friends admitted to talking about killing people frequently. They even occasionally stalked humans as prey in the woods for fun. While on their bow and arrow hunting trip, the two males eventually ended up stalking an 11-year-old boy named Johnathan Kushner riding his bike down a popular trail in the woods. From there, the accomplice hit the boy with a star bit from a drill stunning the child. Witt and his accomplice gagged the child and threw him in the back of his trunk where the child died from suffocation as a result of the gagging. After driving to a deserted grove, Witt and his accomplice removed the lifeless child in the trunk and slit his stomach to prevent bloating. After, Witt and Tillman performed violent acts on the body, and then buried it in a grave.
Procedural history
After being convicted of first degree murder on February 21, 1974, Witt was also sentenced to the death penalty. Witt appealed this sentence for five different issues which included the court not allowing evidence to prove insanity, the court's alleged use of non-record material in reviewing his sentence, the state forcing him to admit guilt before he was allowed the right to an attorney, and how the court relied on non-statutory aggravated circumstances however still sentenced him to capital punishment. All four of those mentioned claims were almost immediately thrown out. The only legitimate and significant appeal he made was his belief that the jury had been death qualified because three of the jurors were "improperly excluded for cause because of their opposition to capital punishment."
In a previous U.S. Supreme Court case, Witherspoon vs. Illinois (1968), the Court came to the conclusion that "prospective jurors could not be disqualified from jury service simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against it. However, a state may exclude those jurors who would automatically vote against the death penalty, or those jurors whose attitudes about the death penalty would affect their decision regarding the defendant's guilt or innocence." Therefore, the state of Florida could, in fact, force a juror to step down if it is unmistakably clear that he or she would automatically vote not guilty or guilty for personal or religious beliefs. Witt's argument was that jurors, who wouldn't automatically vote not guilty on the death penalty, still were forced to step down simply because they didn't like the death penalty and were more likely to vote not guilty. This, he argued, was a violation of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.
Opinion of the Court
The Court found that Witt's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were not violated by the voir dire process that took place before the trial began. They effectively found that the court does have a right to ask a juror to step down pretrial if in fact their beliefs do affect the verdict of the trial in any way. Witt's appeals were dismissed even before a 4th hearing took place. Witt wasn't the first person who took an appeal to Supreme Court because he was sentenced to death by a death qualified jury. For example, Knighton v. Maggio, Witherspoon v. Illinois, and Woodward v. Hutchins were cases in which all the defendants claimed their Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated and all of their appeals were denied as well. What made the Witt vs. Wainwright case so significant was the fact that the court did find that the prosecutor, during one of the exchanges over voir dire, did not properly excuse one of the jurors for the "Witherspoon claim." The juror, named Ms.Colby, stated that during the voir dire process, she thought that her judging of innocence or guilt may be affected due to the death penalty. She didn't say, however, that she would automatically vote not guilty.
Mr. Plowman [for the State]: Now, let me ask you a question, ma'am. Do you have any religious beliefs or personal beliefs against the death penalty?
Ms. Colby: I am afraid personally but not—Mr. Plowman: Speak up, please.
Ms. Colby: I am afraid of being a little personal, but definitely not religious.
Mr. Plowman: Now, would that interfere with you sitting as a juror in this case?
Ms. Colby: I am afraid it would.
Mr. Plowman: You are afraid it would?
Ms. Colby: yes, sir.
Mr. Plowman: Would it interfere with judging the guilt or innocence of the defendant in this case?
Ms. Colby: I think so.
Mr. Plowman: You think it would?
Ms. Colby: I think it would.
Mr. Plowman: Your Honor, I would move for cause at this point.
THE COURT: All right.Step down.
She was excused from the jury. The Supreme Court ruled to overlook this as evident by the denial of appeal, almost rewriting the ruling given down by Witherspoon vs. Illinois, ultimately changing how jurors can be excused due to their opinions on the death penalty.
Historical context
The Supreme Court revised the standards set forth in Witherspoon with the standards provided by Wainwright v. Witt in terms of how a jury can become death qualified. "The Witt standard gave more discretion to the judge in death qualification. The judge decides whether the jurors' attitudes toward the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair their ability to decide on sentence fairly." The Witt outcome produced a more death qualified jury. A judge now needs to decide whether a juror's attitude toward the death penalty would alter his decision about guilt or innocence, unlike before, where the juror had to state that he would automatically vote guilty or not guilty due to his beliefs, in order to excuse him from the jury. A more death qualified jury affects many cases involving the death penalty in numerous ways. This is because studies show that African-Americans and other minority groups in the USA tend to be more opposed to the death penalty compared to Caucasians. Females also tend to be more opposed to the death penalty than males. Therefore, juries who are death qualified tend to have more white males than any other racial or ethnic group.  A death qualified jury also creates a "conviction prone" jury as well. This is due to the fact that jurors who support the death penalty are generally less sympathetic toward the defendant. Results of numerous studies show that "subjects who had served on the mixed juries were generally more critical of the witnesses, less satisfied with their juries, and better able to remember the evidence than subjects from the death-qualified juries."  This is not to mention the voir dire process itself, which asks jurors about their morals and beliefs on the death penalty, which in itself suggests that the case will not only involve capital punishment, but also that the defendant is most likely guilty.
Conclusion
Witt appealed his sentence of capital punishment because he felt a death qualified jury violated his 6th and 14th Amendments, especially with the removal of Ms.Colby from the jury. Unfortunately for him, the standards set by Witherspoon v. Illinois (1968) did not apply to his case. Instead, his case brought new standards that ultimately shaped how a jury can be changed in a trial involving capital punishment. These standards have been researched, criticized, and even brought back to Supreme Court as evident in Lockhart v. McCree (1986) and Uttecht v. Brown (2007). No matter how many appeals get brought to the Supreme Court, they still back the same standards set by Witt over 25 years ago. These standards laid down the foundations and guidelines on how we choose a death qualified jury to this day.
Witt was executed the next day, March 6, 1985.

From "Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind" ==> """
Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind, 474 U.S. 481 (1986), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court ruled that the Establishment Clause did not prevent the state of Washington from providing financial vocational assistance to a blind man who sought to study at a Christian college to become a pastor, missionary, or youth pastor. The Court ruled that the Establishment Clause does not prevent financial assistance from a state vocational rehabilitation program from being used for religious instruction.
Background
Larry Witters was eligible under Washington state law to receive financial assistance to pursue vocational instruction. At the time, he was attending a private Bible college with the intent to pursue a career as a pastor, missionary, or youth minister. The Commission for the Blind denied him aid on the basis that the Washington State Constitution barred state funds from being used to assist an individual in pursuit of a career or degree in theology. The Washington Supreme Court sustained the Commission's decision but used the US Constitution as the basis for its decision.
Decision
In a 9-0 holding,https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1985/1985_84_1070 Oyez Project the Court ruled in favor of Witters. The Court reasoned that the test established in Lemon v. Kurtzman was applicable and that aid to Witters would meet the Lemon test. The Court found that there was a clear secular purpose to the law.  Also, the Court ruled that the primary effect of the statute was an effect on Witters, not religion.  Finally, the case was ruled to have no entanglement with religion since the decision as to where the aid money would be spent was made solely by the individual, not by any government agency so the Establishment Clause was not violated..
The case was remanded back to the state court. On  remand,  after  the  United  States Supreme  Court  reversed  the  Establishment  Clause  holding,  the Washington court held the program inconsistent with one of its Blaine Amendments, a decision the United States Supreme Court declined to review.
Counsel
Witters was represented by Michael P. Farris. Timothy R. Malone represented the respondent.

From "Wolf v. Colorado" ==> """
Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25 (1949), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held 6—3 that, while the Fourth Amendment was applicable to the states, the exclusionary rule was not a necessary ingredient of the Fourth Amendment's right against warrantless and unreasonable searches and seizures. In Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383 (1914), the Court held that as a matter of judicial implication the exclusionary rule was enforceable in federal courts but not derived from the explicit requirements of the Fourth Amendment. The Wolf Court decided not to incorporate the exclusionary rule as part of the Fourteenth Amendment in large part because the states which had rejected the Weeks Doctrine (the exclusionary rule) had not left the right to privacy without other means of protection (i.e. the States had their own rules to deter police officers from conducting warrantless and unreasonable searches and seizures). However, because most of the states' rules proved to be ineffective in deterrence, the Court overruled Wolf in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961). That landmark case made history as the exclusionary rule enforceable against the states through the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the same extent that it applied against the federal government.
Background of the case
The appellant, Julius A. Wolf, was convicted in the District Court of the City and County of Denver of conspiracy to perform criminal abortions. On appeal, the convictions were affirmed by the Supreme Court of Colorado (187 P.2d 926, 928). Wolf appealed the conviction by a writ of certiorari and the U.S. Supreme Court decided to hear the appeal.
Court's decision
The essential question presented before the Court was whether states are required by the Fourth and the Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to exclude illegally seized evidence from trial.
Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter delivered the opinion of the court in this case, in which Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and Associate Justices Stanley Forman Reed, Robert H. Jackson, and Harold Hitz Burton joined. Associate Justice Hugo Black wrote a separate concurring opinion.
Writing dissenting opinions were Associate Justices William O. Douglas, Frank Murphy (in whose opinion Justice Rutledge joined), and Wiley Blount Rutledge (in whose opinion Justice Murphy joined).
Frankfurter's opinion for the majority
In its 6-to-3 decision, the Court affirmed the decision of the lower courts. It stated that although exclusion of evidence is indeed an effective way of discouraging and preventing unreasonable searches, there exist other methods that can achieve the same effect while complying with the minimal standards set by the Due Process Clause. As an example, the Court suggested civil remedies, such as “the internal discipline of the police, under the eyes of an alert public opinion.”
The main question Justice Felix Frankfurter considers in his opinion is whether a conviction by a state court that arises out of use of evidence that would not have been admitted in a federal court of law denies the defendant due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.
This question relates directly to the issue of incorporation of the Bill of Rights. Frankfurter states that unlike the requirements regarding administration of criminal justice by federal authority imposed by the Bill of Rights (Amendments I to VIII), the Fourteenth Amendment does not impose similar limitations upon states. He cites the notion that due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is shorthand for the first eight amendments of the Constitution, and flatly rejects it, commenting that “the issue is closed.”Justice Frankfurter notes that the equation of the Fourteenth Amendment with the first eight amendments has been rejected by the Court numerous times, “after impressive consideration.” For earlier cases involving this consideration, see Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516, 292; Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78; Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 287; Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, and Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46.
In considering the restrictions which the Due Process Clause imposes upon states in regards to enforcement of criminal law, the Court does not stray far from the views expressed in Palko v. Connecticut, . In that decision, Associate Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo rejected the notion that the Due Process Clause incorporates the original Bill of Rights.
The Court does go on to find, through its selective incorporation doctrine, that the Fourth Amendment's proscription of unreasonable searches and seizures is "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, and as such enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause."  However, enforcement of this basic right raises further questions, e.g., how to check such police conduct, what remedies are appropriate against it, and so forth.
The important precedent relevant in this case arises from Weeks v. United States, (1914).The landmark case of Weeks v. United States (1914) established the exclusionary rule, prohibiting the use of illegally seized evidence. In this case, a federal marshal had seized papers without a proper warrant. See also Ernest W. Machen, The Law of Search and Seizure (1950), and  The main consequence of the unanimous ruling in Weeks was that in a federal prosecution, the Fourth Amendment prohibited the use of evidence obtained by an illegal search and seizure. Frankfurter notes, with apparent disapproval, that this 1914 ruling “was not derived from the explicit requirements of the Fourth Amendment,” nor “based on legislation expressing Congressional policy in the enforcement of the Constitution.” However, because the rule has been frequently applied since, “we stoutly adhere to it.”
However, Frankfurter reaffirms, the immediate question at hand is whether this basic right to protection against arbitrary intrusion by the police in a federal case extends to state cases as well. He writes that because most of the English-speaking world “does not regard as vital … the exclusion of evidence such obtained,” the Court must hesitate “to treat this remedy as an essential ingredient of the right.”
Frankfurter writes that although the practice of exclusion of evidence is indeed an efficient way of deterring unlawful searches, the Court cannot condemn other equally effective methods as falling below the minimal standards required by the Due Process Clause. Further, there exist reasons for excluding evidence obtained by the federal police that are less compelling in the case of state or local authority.
He concludes that because of the above reasons, the Court holds that “in a prosecution in a State Court for a State crime, the Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid the admission of evidence obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure.”
Black's concurrence
In a concurring opinion, Associate Justice Hugo L. Black notes that as per his previous dissents, he agrees that the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizure is enforceable against the states.See Justice Hugo L. Black’s dissenting opinion in Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 68, 1683, 171 A.L.R. 1223. He writes that he would be in favor of the reversal of the decision of the lower courts if he thought that the Fourth Amendment, by itself, barred not only unreasonable searches and seizures, but also the use of evidence so obtained. However, he agrees with the implication evident from the Court's opinion in that the federal exclusionary rule is “not a command of the Fourth Amendment but is a judicially created rule of evidence which Congress might negate.”See McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332. He concludes that this implication leads him “to concur in the Court’s judgment of affirmance.”
Douglas' dissent
Associate Justice William O. Douglas writes in his dissenting opinion that for the reasons stated by Justice Hugo L. Black in his dissent in Adamson v. California,See the dissent by Associate Justice Hugo L. Black in Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 68, 1684, 171 A.L.R. 1223. he believes that the Fourth Amendment is applicable to the States. He agrees with Justice Frank Murphy's assertion that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded in state as well as in federal prosecutions; in absence of such exclusion, “the Amendment would have no effective sanction.”
Murphy's dissent
In his dissent opinion, with which Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge concurs, Associate Justice Frank Murphy takes issue with the majority opinion's suggestion that there exist alternatives to the exclusionary rule. He complains that this very statement “conveys the impression that one possibility is as effective as the next,” while, in his opinion, there is only one alternative to the rule of exclusion – and that is “no sanction at all.”
Murphy openly questions the Court's suggestion of self-regulation, scoffing at the notion of expecting “a District Attorney to prosecute himself…for well-meaning violations of the search and seizure clause during a raid the District Attorney…[has] ordered.”Justice Murphy cites Pound, Criminal Justice in America (New York, 1930) to support his argument: “Under our legal system the way of the prosecutor is hard, and the need of 'getting results' puts pressure upon prosecutors to indulge in that lawless enforcement of law which produces a vicious circle of disrespect for law.” Murphy suggests another alternative, somewhat parenthetically, whereas a trespass action for damages could be used as “a venerable means of securing reparation for unauthorized invasion of the home.”
Rutledge's dissent
Associate Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge writes a dissenting opinion, with which Justice Frank Murphy concurs. He rejects the Court's conclusion that the mandate of the Fourth Amendment, though binding on the states, does not carry with it the sanction of the exclusionary rule. He agrees with Justice Murphy's assertion that the “Amendment without the sanction is a dead letter.”
He also rejects the Court's suggestion that Congress could genuinely enact legislation that would permit the use in federal courts of evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, noting that this issue had previously – and negatively – been settled in Boyd v. United States.In explaining his reasoning, Justice Rutledge writes, “I had thought that issue settled by this Court's invalidation on dual grounds, in Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, of a federal statute which in effect required the production of evidence thought probative by Government counsel – the Court there holding the statute to be 'obnoxious to the prohibition of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, as well as of the Fifth.' Id., at page 632, 6 S.Ct. at page 533. See Adams v. New York, 192 U.S. 585, 597, 598, 375. The view that the Fourth Amendment itself forbids the introduction of evidence illegally obtained in federal prosecutions is one of long standing and firmly established. See Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 462, 567, 66 A.L.R. 376. It is too late in my judgment to question it now. We apply it today in Lustig v. United States, 338 U.S. 74.”
Justice Rutledge concludes by saying that the Court makes “the illegality of this search and seizure its inarticulate premise of decision.” He concurs with this premise, and believes that the conviction should be reversed.

From "Wolfe v. North Carolina" ==> """
Wolfe v. North Carolina, 364 U.S. 177 (1960), is a 1960 United States Supreme Court case in which the court, in a 5–4 decision, upheld the trespassing conviction of six African-American men who were barred from a golf course because of their race.
 Background 
In December 1955, six African-American men (Leon Wolfe, George Simkins, Jr., Philip Cook, Sam Murray, Elijah Herring, and Joseph Sturdivant) went to the Gillespie Golf Course in Greensboro, North Carolina, which had been built with public funds. The six paid greens fees and began to play despite being told they would not be allowed to. That night, the six were charged with trespassing, and convicted on that charge in February 1956, a conviction which was set aside by the North Carolina Supreme Court in June of the following year. A retrial convicted the six again in 1958.
In the meantime, Simkins, who had been one of the six, filed suit in Federal District Court (Simkins v. City of Greensboro) and obtained an injunction in March 1957 against the golf course preventing them from operating the course through a private contractor on a discriminatory basis. That injunction was upheld on appeal to the Fourth Circuit.
The second conviction was appealed to the North Carolina Supreme Court, who upheld it, and was then appealed (the present case) to the United States Supreme Court.
 Opinion of the Court 
Stewart authored the opinion of the Court, which found no evidence in the record that the exclusion of the six from the golf course had been discriminatory, the record which reached the Court had not included the record of the federal trial and injunction.  Finding that the North Carolina Supreme Court had consistently avoided any investigations of its own regarding the accuracy of a trial record, the Court held that North Carolina had not acted improperly when it had refused to  look into the accuracy of the record in this case. As a result, the majority found that there was not a federal question.
The dissent, penned by Chief Justice Warren, said that the record showed that the appellants had in fact offered proof of the federal injunction and trial into the record, and that the case should have been, as a result remanded or decided on the merits.
 Subsequent developments 
In July 1964 the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, which outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin in public accommodations.

From "Wolff v. McDonnell" ==> """
Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that prisoners retained some due process rights when incarcerated. In particular, the Court ruled that due process required that prison disciplinary decisions to revoke good-time credits must be accompanied by notification of the inmate, administrative hearings, the chance to call witnesses and present evidence, and a written statement detailing the nature of the offense committed and the evidence for said offense. 
Background
In 1974, Robert O. McDonnell, an inmate at the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, filed a class action lawsuit  against Warden Charles Wolff Jr., charging, among other complaints, that the disciplinary proceedings hearings at the prison were biased and violated due process, that the inspection of all incoming and outbound mail (including mail to and from attorneys) was unreasonable, and that the legal assistance available to inmates was lacking. At the time, the process for disciplinary proceedings involved the prisoner being orally informed of the nature of the charges against them, a report being written by a committee, and the report being read to the inmate. If the inmate denied the charge, they could inquire as to the charging party, but could not cross-examine or present any witnesses. Penalties imposed by the hearings could include loss of good-time credits.
The district court granted only partial relief: it rejected the due process claim, and stated that the legal assistance was not unconstitutionally defective, but found the inspection of mail to violate the right of access to the courts.
The Eighth Circuit reversed the district court on the due process claim, affirmed the judgment regarding mail, and ordered hearings into the quality of legal assistance.
Robert Bork, in his capacity as Solicitor General of the United States, argued as amicus curiae, urging reversal of the judgment of the circuit court.
Opinion of the Court
In the majority opinion authored by Justice White, the Court rejected the idea that prisoners were wholly deprived of their rights under the Constitution.
Nevertheless, the majority opinion also recognized that reasonable constraints were, given the nature of imprisonment, not restrictive, especially when pertaining to issues of due process:
The Court went on to note that prisoners were entitled to written notice of violations, at least a day in advance of any hearing, and a written statement from the committee regarding the evidence used and the reasons for a disciplinary hearing. So long as the acts were not "unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals", the prisoner could also call witnesses and present evidence in their defense, the Court ruled; the unrestricted right to do so would disrupt the authority of prison officials to provide for the safety of others. Likewise, allowing cross-examination would heighten the potential for disruption and danger; and allowing counsel would cause delay and reduce the utility of the proceedings.
The Court declined to rule on the impartiality of the committee, noting its mandate and the regulations that controlled it.
As for the question of searching the mail, the Court ruled that it had no issue with states requiring attorneys to specially mark their mail, with name and address; and said that opening mail in the presence of inmates did not constitute censorship.
The Court affirmed the Eighth Circuit on the issue of insufficient inmate legal assistance, and remanded the case for further judgment.
Marshall's opinion
Justice Marshall, joined by Brennan, agreed on the issues of mail inspection and legal assistance, but disagreed with the majority on the matter of due process. In Marshall's view, inmates did not lose their rights by entering prison, and, in accordance with that, believed that the lack of confrontation and cross-examination in the majority opinion was the Court denying basic constitutional rights to inmates. 
Douglas's opinion
Justice Douglas believed the entirety of a "full hearing with all due process safeguards" was needed before punishments such as solitary confinement could be imposed.

From "Wong Sun v. United States" ==> """
Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963), is a United States Supreme Court decision excluding the presentation of verbal evidence and recovered narcotics where they were both fruits of an illegal entry.  Narcotics agents unlawfully entered Toy's laundry at which point Toy indicated that Jonny was selling narcotics. The drug agents then went to Jonny and found the narcotics. Jonny made a deal to give up his supplier, Wong Sun. The agents then arrested Wong Sun. All were arraigned and released on their own recognizance. Several days later, Wong Sun voluntarily returned to the police station to make a statement, during the process of which he confessed.
In a trial in a Federal District Court without a jury, they were convicted of fraudulent and knowing transportation and concealment of illegally imported heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §174. Although the Court of Appeals held that the arrests of both petitioners without warrants were illegal, because not based on "probable cause" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment nor "reasonable grounds" within the meaning of the Narcotics Control Act of 1956, it affirmed their convictions.
 Supreme Court Ruling 
The Supreme Court held that: 
 On the record in this case, there was neither reasonable grounds nor probable cause for Toy's arrest, since the information upon which it was based was too vague and came from too untested a source to accept it as probable cause for the issuance of an arrest warrant; and this defect was not cured by the fact that Toy fled when a supposed customer at his door early in the morning revealed that he was a narcotics agent. 
 On the record in this case, the statements made by Toy in his bedroom at the time of his unlawful arrest were the fruits of the agents' unlawful action, and they should have been excluded from evidence. 
 The narcotics taken from a third party as a result of statements made by Toy at the time of his arrest were likewise fruits of the unlawful arrest, and they should not have been admitted as evidence against Toy.
 After exclusion of the foregoing items of improperly admitted evidence, the only proofs remaining to sustain Toy's conviction are his and his codefendant's unsigned statements; any admissions of guilt in Toy's statement require corroboration; no reference to Toy in his codefendant's statement constitutes admissible evidence corroborating any admission by Toy, and Toy's conviction must be set aside for lack of competent evidence to support it. 
 In view of the fact that, after his unlawful arrest, petitioner Wong Sun had been lawfully arraigned and released on his own recognizance and had returned voluntarily several days later when he made his unsigned statement, the connection between his unlawful arrest and the making of that statement was so attenuated that the unsigned statement was not the fruit of the unlawful arrest and, therefore, it was properly admitted in evidence. 
 The seizure of the narcotics admitted in evidence invaded no right of privacy of person or premises which would entitle Wong Sun to object to its use at his trial.
 Any references to Wong Sun in his codefendant's statement were incompetent to corroborate Wong Sun's admissions, and Wong Sun is entitled to a new trial, because it is not clear from the record whether or not the trial court relied upon his codefendant's statement as a source of corroboration of Wong Sun's confession.
Toy's statements and the discovered drugs at Jonny's should both be excluded as fruit of the poisonous tree because the search was done without a warrant. Wong Sun's lawyer argued that Wong Sun's confession should also be excluded as fruit of the poisonous tree. Wong Sun's statement was ruled admissible because he had no standing to move to suppress the evidence found in Jonny's apartment. Wong Sun was granted a new trial, but his confession was admissible.

From "Wong Wing v. United States" ==> """
Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U.S. 228 (1896), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court found that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution forbid the imprisonment at hard labor without a jury trial for noncitizens convicted of illegal entry to or presence in the United States.
The case began in 1892 when Wong Wing and three other Chinese nationals were arrested for unlawful presence in the United States, violating the Geary Act. A commissioner of the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Michigan sentenced the four men to 60 days imprisonment at hard labor, after which they would be deported to China. After the prisoners' petitions, for writs of habeas corpus were denied, the Supreme Court granted cert.
In May 1896, the Supreme Court reversed the circuit court's judgment, ruling that Wing's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the commissioner lacked jurisdiction to sentence Wing to imprisonment at hard labor. The circuit court shouldn't have denied Wing's habeas corpus petition because Wing was sentenced to a criminal punishment without a jury trial. Thus the Court reversed the circuit court's judgment.
This case established that noncitizens subject to criminal proceedings are entitled to the same constitutional protections available to citizens. The Court held that the protections guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments extend to foreign nationals as well as American citizens. The ruling was issued on the same day as the Court upheld racial segregation laws in its infamous Plessy v. Ferguson decision.
 Background 
 Geary Act 
The Geary Act of 1892, an extension of the Chinese Exclusion Act, denied U.S. citizenship to Chinese immigrants. The Act required Chinese residents to carry residence certificates issued by the federal government to prove they entered the country legally. Section 4 of the Act of 1892 provides:
Briefly, Chinese individuals unlawfully present in the U.S. faced up to a year of imprisonment and hard labor followed by deportation.
 Incident 
On July 15, 1892, John Graves, commissioner of the U.S. Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, ruled that Wong Wing, Lee Poy, Lee You Tong, and Chan Wah Dong were illegal Chinese in the United States and had no right to remain in the United States. John Graves ruled that these people be imprisoned in the Detroit House of Correction for 60 days of hard labor from and including the date of commitment; in the end, they were to be removed from the United States to China.
The Chinese thus immediately applied for a writ of habeas corpus to the judges of the United States Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, requesting the release of their imprisonment and restraint of their liberty, alleging that doing so was unlawful, without warrant of law and contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States. The rules were based on the Geary Act of1892,  entitled "An Act to prohibit the coming of Chinese persons into the United States."
 District Appeal 
On July 22, 1892, after hearing arguments from counsel, the district court ordered that the writ of habeas corpus be discharged and that the persons arrested be remanded to the custody of Nicholson, the keeper of the District house of correction, to serve their original sentences. Based on this decision, an appeal was filed with the Supreme Court. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.
 Opinion of the Court 
In a majority opinion by Justice Shiras, the Court explained that Congress has the power to exclude, deport, and detain classes of noncitizens as a matter of public policy. Because deportation isn't a criminal punishment, Congress may deport noncitizens without a jury trial. However, imprisonment at hard labor is a criminal punishment, and imposing criminal punishment without a jury trial to establish a defendant's guilt violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The Court emphasized that constitutional protections aren't limited to United States citizens. Any person within the United States is entitled to the protections guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. As a resident in the United States, Wong Wing is entitled to the Fifth Amendment right to due process and the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. Wing was being held without being afforded those protections. Accordingly, Wing's petition for a writ of habeas corpus was granted. The judgment of the circuit court was reversed.
The Court first emphasized the validity of Chae Chan Ping v. United States (130 U.S. 581). Mr. Justice Field held that the Act to exclude Chinese laborers from the United States was a constitutional exercise of legislative power. The Court affirmed that Section 6 of the May 5, 1892 Act was constitutional and valid by reaffirming Fong Yue Ting v. United States (149 U.S. 698). The Court then cited Lem Moon Sing v. United States (158 U.S. 538), in which the Court rejected the petitioner's writ of habeas corpus. Mr. Justice Harlan, expressing the opinion of the Court, said that Congress exercised its power to exclude aliens solely through the executive, without judicial intervention, as determined by our previous decisions.
The Court pointed out the present appeal presented a different question the questions previously determined. The current question was whether a Chinese person can be lawfully convicted and sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor for a definite period by a commissioner without indictment or trial by jury. The question involved the constitutionality of Section 4 of the Act of 1892. the Court argued that:
However, the Geary Act imposed imprisonment and hard labor in addition to deportation in an attempt to deter violations of the Act. To this regard, the Court expressed:
The Court then cited Ex parte Wilson (114 U.S. 428) to declare that incarceration at hard labor was considered an infamous punishment. Also, in Yick Wo v. Hopkins (118 U.S. 356, 369), the Court ruled the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution is not limited to the protection of citizens. The Court applied the rule of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.
The Court finally decided that Section 4 of the 1892 Act was invalid because it conflicted with the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which states that "no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or other infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, ... nor be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law," and is also in conflict with the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides" in all criminal proceedings, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed."
The Court reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court.
 Concurring and Dissenting Decision 
Justice Field concurred in part and dissented in part.
Justice Field agreed that Wong was entitled to be discharged from his arrest and imprisonment because the government could only lawfully punish both citizens and noncitizens after a jury trial. However, he expressed deep concern about the government's argument that constitutional protections do not apply to political offenses committed by those who illegally enter and remain in the United States. He emphasized that the right to deport and exclude noncitizens does not give the government the right to inflict harsh and brutal punishment on them without constitutional safeguards.
Justice Brewer took no part in the decision of this case.
 Significance 
Wong Wing v. United States was the first Supreme Court decision to invalidate a federal immigration statute, the first Supreme Court decision to hold that the Bill of Rights protects aliens from the federal government, and the first Supreme Court decision to affirm the constitutional rights of illegal aliens. Wong Wing v. United States addressed the power of Congress over immigration, the constitutional protection of aliens from the federal government, the rights of illegal aliens, the distinction between civil detention and criminal penalties, and the nature of hard labor as punishment.
A series of decisions issued by the judiciary in the 1880s and 1890s gave the executive branch broad authority to impose immigration restrictions in the name of national security. In Wong Wing v. United States, the Supreme Court further distinguished deportation from punishment. This decision placed immigration in a separate government bureaucracy. Since then, immigration cases have been handled by immigration officials, and an independent immigration court system has made legal decisions with fewer civic protections.
Wong Wing v. United States reaffirmed that deportation itself is not a punishment. This finding was later used to suggest that while immigration law violators cannot be sentenced to prison without constitutional due process, they can be detained - i.e., imprisoned - pending deportation. Extending Wong Wing's rationale, the Court held that because deportation is not punishment, indefinite incarceration pending deportation is not punishment either. Similarly, deportation is a civil action and not a criminal action.

From "Wood v. Moss" ==> """
Wood v. Moss, 572 U.S. 744 (2014), was a United States Supreme Court case holding secret service officers who moved protesters away from the president were protected by qualified immunity. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the opinion for a unanimous court. The case arose out of a campaign stop President George W. Bush made during the 2004 presidential campaign. Prior to the campaign event, Bush dined at a restaurant near where a group of supporters and a group of protesters had gathered. Two secret service agents directed local police to move the protesters to protect the president. The protesters sued the agents in the U.S. District Court of the District of Oregon. The agents filed a motion to dismiss which was eventually granted based upon the Supreme Court's decision.
Background
Factual background
President George W. Bush went to Jacksonville, Oregon for a campaign event for the 2004 presidential election. Two groups assembled, with permission, on opposite sides of a street near the venue: a group of supporters and a group of protesters. President Bush decided to make an unplanned stop for food at the Jacksonville Inn prior to the event, causing the protesters to move closer to the restaurant.. Two secret service officers, with the help of local police, made the decision to move the protesters to another block, causing the protesters to then be further away from restaurant than the supporters. After the President's meal, the President's motorcade left the restaurant and its route left protesters too far away to be seen or heard.
Procedural history
The protesters filed suit against the two secret service agents in U. S. District Court for the District of Oregon. The protesters claimed the actions of the officers had violated the protesters' First Amendment rights, specifically engaging in view point discrimination by moving the protesters further away than the supporters. The agents moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and further arguing they were protected by qualified immunity. The District Court denied the motion. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit then reversed on interlocutory appeal, but instructed the lower court to allow protesters the opportunity to amend their complaint. The protesters supplemented their complaint with allegations the secret service systematically attempted to remove protesters from the vicinity of event sites and motorcade routes. Ibid. The agents again moved to dismiss and the District Court denied the motion. On a second interlocutory appeal the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.
Opinion of the Court
In a unanimous opinion, authored by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court held the two secret service agents were entitled to qualified immunity. To circumvent the doctrine of qualified immunity, the protesters would need to show the violation of a constitutional right and that the right was "clearly established" at the time of the conduct. Only one prior Supreme Court case had addressed the qualified immunity of secret service agents. Hunter v. Bryant,  applied qualified immunity to secret service agents who had arrested an individual for a threat to assassinate the president. In other cases, the Court has recognized the importance of protecting the chief executive. Ibid.
Although the Ninth Circuit had found fault with the secret service agents for failing to provide a reason for treating the supporters and protesters differently, the Supreme Court found that no existing law would have alerted the secret service agents that they had an obligation under the First Amendment to give each group comparable locations at all times.  The Court was persuaded there was a security motive for moving the protesters, who had been in weapons range with an unobstructed view of the President dining on the patio and there would have been no such rationale for moving the supporters. Ibid. No existing law required the secret service to interfere with the speech rights of supporters more than security concerns necessitated.
The Court also rejected the protesters' allegation that the secret service agents moved the protesters to engage in viewpoint discrimination. After noting that a White House manual urging political operatives to work with secret service designate a protest area outside of the view of presidential motorcades was not actually the policy of the secret service itself, the Court noted the actual agents themselves would need to have acted with discriminatory intent. The Court found it persuasive that a security motive existed for moving the protesters. 
Subsequent legal action
The Supreme Court's decision dismissed the claims against the two secret service agents, however, other claims against the Jacksonville Chief of Police, the city of Jacksonville and former Sheriff remained active. Protesters who were detained were certified as a class whereas individual claims of excessive force, including a claim from Michael Moss, the named respondent in Wood v. Moss, proceeded individually.
Responses and analysis
This case was one of several to allege the Bush administration used the secret service to keep protesters away from Bush's public appearances.
The New Republic found the decision to be a hopeful one for future protections for free speech. Although the protesters lost, The New Republic noted that the Court indicated that acting purely based on viewpoint discrimination might have yielded a different result. The New Republic also found Ginsburg's treatment of the field manual as disapproving.
The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement expressing its disappointment with the decision to dismiss the case. The organization believed a jury should have been able to decide whether the secret service was censuring speech.

From "Wooden v. United States" ==> """
Wooden v. United States, 595 U.S. ___ (2022), was a Supreme Court of the United States case dealing with the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that multiple criminal offenses that a person commits during a single criminal episode do not count as separate convictions when considering the number of prior convictions a criminal has under the ACCA.
Background
In 1997, William Wooden was involved with the burglary of a self-storage space, breaking into ten adjacent units within a single night. He was convicted on ten counts of burglary and served an eight-year prison sentence. Later, in 2014, Wooden was arrested for possession of a rifle under Georgia law when a police officer, out of uniform and without a warrant, entered his home and discovered the rifle. The charges were later dismissed due to the irregularities of the discovery, but federal officers stepped in to charge Wooden for possession of firearms under the ACCA. While a first-time conviction under the ACCA would normally lead to a sentence of 21 to 27 months, federal prosecutors believed that the ten prior convictions from the storage burglary were separate "occasions" under the ACCA, and triggered the enhanced sentencing provision of the ACCA for criminals that have been convictions on three or more separate occasions, setting a minimum sentence of 15 years.
While Wooden argued that the ten burglary convinctions should be treated as a single occasion for purposes of the ACCA, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee found in favor of the government's argument, as this stance was based on current case law for the Sixth Circuit. The decision was upheld on appeal at the Sixth Circuit.
Supreme Court
The Supreme Court granted Wooden's petition in February 2021. The case was argued on October 4, 2021.
The Court issued its decision on March 8, 2022. The judgement was unanimous, reversing the decision of the lower courts. The majority opinion was written by Justice Elena Kagan, joined in whole by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh and all but Part II-B by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Amy Coney Barrett. Kagan wrote that based both on the legislative history of the ACCA and the ordinary meaning of "occasion", that the ten burglary convictions that Wooden had received were all within the same occasion. "Consider first how an ordinary person (a reporter; a police officer; yes, even a lawyer) might describe Wooden’s 10 burglaries — and how she would not", Kagan wrote.
While Justice Barrett wrote a concurrence in part and in the judgment which was joined by Justice Thomas, she wrote that she took issue with Justice Kagan's use of legislative history as part of the rationale. Kagan had pointed to a 1988 amendment where Congress had made it clear that they intended that the enhanced sentencing was to come from separate episodes by referring to a person that was convicted under the enhanced provisions of the ACCA after performing a stick-up of six people at the same time. Barrett stated this was too much of a stretch for statutory interpretation and that they should defer to what Congress explicitly stated in the law.
Justice Neil Gorsuch also wrote a concurrence in judgement, joined in the most part by Justice Sotomayor. Gorsuch wrote that Wooden's case calls for the use of the rule of lenity, deferring in favor of the defendant when there is ambiguity in criminal law. Gorsuch also expressed concern that the ACCA created enhanced penalties to be decided by a judge rather than by a jury, which may be a violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment.

From "Woodford v. Ngo" ==> """
Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81 (2006), is a United States Supreme Court case about the procedures determining when prison litigation may be commenced in federal court..   Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, ruled that prisoners must exhaust all state-court remedies in accordance with the rules thereof before filing claims in federal court.  Justice Stephen Breyer filed a concurrence.  Justice John Paul Stevens filed a dissent.
 Background 
The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) requires a prisoner to exhaust any available administrative remedies before challenging prison conditions in federal court..  Ngo, an inmate at San Quentin State Prison (serving a life sentence for murder) filed a grievance with California prison officials about conditions in the prison, but it was rejected as untimely under state law.Jeanne Woodford, the named opposing party to the suit, is the warden of San Quentin.  See this brief bio.  He then sued the prison officials under §1983 in the Federal District Court.
The District Court granted the prison officials' motion to dismiss on the ground that respondent had not fully exhausted his administrative remedies under the PLRA.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent had exhausted those remedies because none remained available to him.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari.
 Issue 
The question presented was "whether a prisoner can satisfy the Prison Litigation Reform Act's exhaustion requirement ... by filing an untimely or otherwise procedurally defective administrative grievance or appeal."
 Parties' arguments 
The prison officials argued that a prisoner must complete the administrative review process in accordance with the applicable procedural rules, including deadlines, before bringing suit in federal court.  Ngo's attorneys, on the other hand, argued that this provision simply means that a prisoner may not bring suit in federal court until administrative remedies are no longer available, even if the reason they are no longer available is due to the prisoner's own non-compliance with the applicable rules.
 Opinion of the Court 
Justice Alito, for the majority, ruled in favor of the prison officials, writing that "proper exhaustion demands compliance with an agency's deadlines and other critical procedural rules because no adjudicative system can function effectively without imposing some orderly structure on the course of its proceedings."  The point of the PLRA, he continues, is to avoid "unwarranted federal-court interference with the administration of prisons," and to allow Ngo's interpretation would frustrate the goal of the legislation.
 Concurrence 
Justice Breyer concurred in the judgment.  While he agreed with the Court's interpretation of "exhaustion" in this case, he wrote also that administrative law "contains well established exceptions to exhaustion."
 Dissent 
Justice Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion.  In that dissent, joined by Justices Souter and Ginsburg, Stevens writes that "The plain text of the PLRA simply requires that such administrative remedies as are available be exhausted before the prisoner can take the serious step of filing a federal lawsuit against the officials who hold him in custody."  He interprets this to mean any exhaustion, not just "proper exhaustion," and says that the Court has read its own interpretation into the statute.

Woods v. Cloyd W. Miller Co., 333 U.S. 138 (1948), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the war powers of the United States Congress extend beyond the end of hostilities allowing them to remedy problems caused by a war after it has ended.
Congress passed a law limiting rents in certain areas for the purposes of controlling a deficit of housing due to returning veterans which took effect July 1, 1947.  The following day a landlord demanded increased rent in a covered area of Cleveland.  Hostilities in World War II had been terminated by presidential proclamation on December 31, 1946. 
The Supreme Court found the law valid under the Necessary and Proper and War Powers clauses of the Constitution.  The Court held, "Congress has the power even after the cessation of hostilities to act to control the forces that a short supply of the needed article created."333 U.S. at 143. It indicated the legislative history revealed Congress intended to use its war powers and the war was a "direct and immediate" cause of the problem.  The Court recognized the effects of a war may continue for years and that there might be a point at which the power to legislate to remedy effects of war would violate the Ninth and Tenth Amendments. Such concerns were not a part of this case.

From "Wooley v. Maynard" ==> """
Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that New Hampshire could not constitutionally require citizens to display the state motto upon their license plates when the state motto was offensive to their moral convictions..
 Background 
Since 1969 New Hampshire had required that noncommercial vehicles bear license plates embossed with the state motto, "Live Free or Die".1 N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 263:1 (Supp. 1975) Another New Hampshire statute made it a misdemeanor "knowingly [to obscure] ... the figures or letters on any number plate".N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 262:27-c (Supp. 1975) The term "letters" in this section had been interpreted by the State's highest court in State v. Hoskin to include the state motto.State v. Hoskin, 112 N. H. 332, 295 A. 2d 454 (1972)
 Facts of the case 
George Maynard and his wife, followers of the Jehovah's Witnesses faith (albeit disfellowshipped), viewed the motto as repugnant to their moral, religious, and political beliefs, and for this reason, they covered up the motto on the license plates of their jointly owned family automobiles. On November 27, 1974, Maynard was issued a citation for violating the state statutes regarding obscuring of the state motto.
 Prior history 
On December 6, 1974, Maynard appeared pro se in Lebanon District Court to answer the charge. After waiving his right to counsel, he entered a plea of not guilty and proceeded to explain his religious objections to the motto.  religious training and belief, I believe my 'government – Jehovah's Kingdom – offers everlasting life. It would be contrary to that belief to give up my life for the state, even if it meant living in bondage. ...  slogan is directly at odds with my deeply held religious convictions ... I also disagree with the motto on political grounds. I believe that life is more precious than freedom." The state trial judge expressed sympathy for Maynard's situation, but considered himself bound by the authority of State v. Hoskin, 112 N.H. 332 (1972),State v. Hoskin, 112 N.H. 332 (1972), a decision by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire: http://law.justia.com/cases/new-hampshire/supreme-court/1972/6354-0.html to hold Maynard guilty. The court imposed a $25 fine, but suspended it during "good behavior".
On December 28, 1974, Maynard was again charged with violating 262:27-c. He appeared in court on January 31, 1975, and again chose to represent himself; he was found guilty, fined $50, and sentenced to six months in the Grafton County House of Corrections. The court suspended this jail sentence but ordered Maynard to also pay the $25 fine for the first offense. Maynard informed the court that, as a matter of conscience, he refused to pay the two fines. The court thereupon sentenced him to jail for a period of 15 days. He served the full sentence.
Prior to trial on the second offense Maynard was charged with yet a third violation of 262:27-c on January 3, 1975. He appeared on this complaint on the same day as for the second offense, and was, again, found guilty. This conviction was "continued for sentence" so that Maynard received no punishment in addition to the 15 days.
On March 4, 1975, the Maynards sued in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against enforcement of N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 262:27-c, 263:1, insofar as these required displaying the state motto on their vehicle license plates, and made it a criminal offense to obscure the motto. On March 11, 1975, the District Court issued a temporary restraining order against further arrests and prosecutions of the Maynards. Because the appellees sought an injunction against a state statute on grounds of its unconstitutionality, a three-judge District Court was convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281. Following a hearing on the merits, the District Court entered an order enjoining the State "from arresting and prosecuting [the Maynards] at any time in the future for covering over that portion of their license plates that contains the motto 'Live Free or Die.
The Governor of New Hampshire chose to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, and it accepted the case.
Decision of the court
In a 6–3 decision, the Court held that New Hampshire could not constitutionally require citizens to display the state motto upon their vehicle license plates. Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court, found that the statute in question effectively required individuals to "use their private property as a 'mobile billboard' for the State's ideological message". The Court held that the State's interests in requiring the motto did not outweigh free speech principles under the First Amendment, including "the right of individuals to hold a point of view different from the majority and to refuse to foster ... an idea they find morally objectionable". The state's interest in motor vehicle identification could be achieved by "less drastic means", and its interest in fostering state pride was not viewpoint-neutral.
Dissents
Justice Rehnquist wrote a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun joined. Rehnquist wrote that
For First Amendment principles to be implicated, the State must place the citizen in the position of either apparently or actually "asserting as true" the message. This was the focus of Barnette [West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943)], and clearly distinguishes this case from that one.
In holding that the New Hampshire statute does not run afoul of our holding in Barnette, the New Hampshire Supreme Court ... aptly articulated why there is no required affirmation of belief in this case:
As found by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in Hoskin, there is nothing in state law which precludes appellees from displaying their disagreement with the state motto as long as the methods used do not obscure the license plates. Thus appellees could place on their bumper a conspicuous bumper sticker explaining in no uncertain terms that they do not profess the motto "Live Free or Die" and that they violently disagree with the connotations of that motto. Since any implication that they affirm the motto can be so easily displaced, I cannot agree that the state statutory system for motor vehicle identification and tourist promotion may be invalidated under the fiction that appellees are unconstitutionally forced to affirm, or profess belief in, the state motto.

From "F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts, Inc." ==> """
F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts, Inc. nicknamed The Cocker Spaniel Case, 344 U.S. 228 (1952), is a United States Supreme Court case regarding copyright infringement.  The Copyright Act of 1909 allows recovery of either the profits of the infringing company or of the damages suffered by the copyright holder as the legal remedies.  When the actual damages cannot be determined, statutory damages can be levied instead.  At issue, is whether the trial judge can impose statutory damages when the actual profits of the infringer are known.
 Copyright infringement 
In 1942, independent artist Elizabeth Anne Philbrick received a copyright for a statuette of a “Cocker-Spaniel in Sitting Position.”  In 1943, Contemporary Arts bought all rights to the artwork.
Contemporary Arts sold the cocker spaniel statuettes in gift shops and art stores in three different grades:.
 Red Plaster version:  MSRP $4
 Red Porcelain version:  $9
 White Porcelain version:  $15
In 1949, Woolworth bought nearly identically-designed statuettes from the Sabin Manufacturing company of McKeesport, Pennsylvania through the Lepere Pottery Company of Zanesville, Ohio.  No evidence was provided that Woolworth's knowingly participated in the copyright infringement.
Woolworth sold the items for only $1.19.  Contemporary Arts provided evidence that the version sold at Woolworth were inferior in quality.  Although Woolworth's attorneys disputed the existence of a copyright violation in the original trial, the appellate court assumed the infringement and focused on the calculation and method for the legal remedy.
 Profits of the Affringer
Woolworth bought 127 dozen dogs at $0.60 each and sold them for $1.19 each for a total gross profits of $899.16.  Woolworth argued that its liability was limited to its own profits.
Although the profits appear substantial by this calculation, Woolworth failed to include allowable deducted for overhead and taxes.  The majority decision found that low-margin sales provided poor remedy to discourage copyright violations.  “If we sustain petitioner's contention that profits may be the sole measure of liability as matter of law, such profits could be diminished even to the vanishing point” the majority decision read.F. W. Woolworth Co., 344 U.S. at 233.  Indeed, if the copyright violating endeavor lost money, no recourse would be available in the courts.
 Damages 
Contemporary Arts presented evidence Woolworth's imitation forced their product out of the marketplace.  The exact dollar total of the damages could not be ascertained however.
The statute allows for statutory damages of between $250 and $5,000 if the violation is not willful.  The trial judge had imposed the maximum $5,000 plus $2,000 in attorneys fees.  The majority upheld that ruling because the statute vested broad discretion to the courts based on the evidence and specifics of each case.   Even though the judge made comments that could be perceived as prejudicial, the ruling was sound.
The majority ruled that falling back on statutory damages was appropriate even though the profit of the offender could be calculated.  In this case, the profits made by Woolworth's were irrelevant when compared to the damage done to Contemporary Arts business model.  “Indeed sales at a small margin might cause more damage to the copyright proprietor than sales of the infringing article at a higher price” read Jackson's decision.
Because Sabin provided indemnification as part of the sale, they actually paid all damages.  They openly assisted the defense as a de facto party in the suit.
 Dissent 
Hugo Black's dissent argued that the court should only resort to statutory fines in lieu of actual damages when they cannot be calculated. While the dissent felt “that the defendant really had a fair and impartial trial” the prejudicial remarks by the trial judge nonetheless warranted a remand for a new trial.

From "Worcester v. Georgia" ==> """
Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515 (1832), was a landmark case in which the United States Supreme Court vacated the conviction of Samuel Worcester and held that the Georgia criminal statute that prohibited non-Native Americans from being present on Native American lands without a license from the state was unconstitutional.
The opinion is most famous for its dicta, which laid out the relationship between tribes and the state and federal governments. It is considered to have built the foundations of the doctrine of tribal sovereignty in the United States.
Background
Samuel Austin Worcester was a missionary to the Cherokee, translator of the Bible, printer, and defender of the Cherokee's sovereignty. He collaborated with Elias Boudinot in the American Southeast to establish the Cherokee Phoenix, the first Native American newspaper.
During this period, the westward push of European-American settlers was continually encroaching on Cherokee territory, even after they had made some land cessions to the  US government. With the help of Worcester and his sponsor, the American Board made a plan to fight the encroachment by using the courts. They wanted to take a case to the U.S. Supreme Court to define the relationship between the federal and state governments, and establish the sovereignty of the Cherokee nation. Hiring William Wirt, a former U.S. Attorney General, the Cherokee argued their position before the U.S. Supreme Court in Georgia v. Tassel (the court granted a writ of error for a Cherokee convicted in a Georgia court for a murder occurring in Cherokee territory, though the state refused to accept the writ) and Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831) (the court dismissed this on technical grounds for lack of jurisdiction). In writing the majority opinion, Chief Justice Marshall described the Cherokee Nation as a "domestic dependent nation" with no rights binding on a state.
Worcester and eleven other missionaries met and published a resolution in protest of an 1830 Georgia law prohibiting all white men from living on Native American land without a state license. While the state law was an effort to restrict white settlement on Cherokee territory, Worcester reasoned that obeying the law would, in effect, be surrendering the sovereignty of the Cherokee Nation to manage their own territory. Once the law had taken effect, Governor George Rockingham Gilmer ordered the militia to arrest Worcester and the others who signed the document and refused to get a license.
After two series of trials, all eleven men were convicted and sentenced to four years of hard labor at the state penitentiary in Milledgeville. Nine accepted pardons, but Worcester and Elizur Butler declined their pardons, so the Cherokee could take the case to the Supreme Court. William Wirt argued the case, but Georgia refused to have a legal counsel represent it, because the state believed the Supreme Court did not have authority to hear the case.
Decision
Chief Justice John Marshall laid out in this opinion that the relationship between the Indian Nations and the United States is that of nations. He reasoned that the United States, in the character of the federal government, inherited the legal rights of The Crown. Those rights, he stated, included the sole right to negotiate with the Indian nations of North America, to the exclusion of all other European powers. This did not include the rights of possession to their land or political dominion over their laws. He acknowledged that the exercise of conquest and purchase can give political dominion, but those are in the hands of the federal government, and individual states had no authority in American Indian affairs. Georgia's statute was therefore invalid.
Associate Justice Henry Baldwin dissented, stating that, in his opinion, the record was not properly returned upon the writ of error, and ought to have been returned by the State court of Georgia, and not by the clerk of the Court of Gwinnett County. As to the merits, he said that his opinion remained the same as was expressed by him in the case of the Cherokee Nation v. Georgia in 1831.
Marshall's language in Worcester may have been motivated by his regret that his earlier opinions in Fletcher v. Peck and Johnson v. M'Intosh had been used as a justification for Georgia's actions. Joseph Story considered it similarly, writing in a letter to his wife dated March 4, 1832: "Thanks be to God, the Court can wash their hands clean of the iniquity of oppressing the Indians and disregarding their rights."
Enforcement
thumb|left|Samuel Worcester
In a popular quotation that is believed to be apocryphal, President Andrew Jackson reportedly responded: "John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!" This quotation first appeared twenty years after Jackson had died, in newspaper publisher Horace Greeley's 1865 history of the U.S. Civil War, The American Conflict. It was, however, reported in the press in March 1832 that Jackson was unlikely to aid in carrying out the court's decision if his assistance were to be requested. In an April 1832 letter to John Coffee, Jackson wrote that "the decision of the Supreme Court has fell still born, and they find that they cannot coerce Georgia to yield to its mandate." In a letter in March 1832, Virginia politician David Campbell reported a private conversation in which Jackson had "sportively" suggested calling on the Massachusetts state militia to enforce the order if the Supreme Court requested he intervene, because Jackson believed Northern partisans had brought about the court's ruling.
The Court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision. Worcester thus imposed no obligations on Jackson; there was nothing for him to enforce, although Jackson's political enemies conspired to find evidence, to be used in the forthcoming political election, to claim that he would refuse to enforce the Worcester decision. Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, Supreme Court cases were to be remanded back down to the lower court for final execution of the Supreme Court's judgment. The Supreme Court could only execute the final judgment in cases where the lower court failed to act on the Supreme Court's directive. Shortly after the Supreme Court's ruling had been issued in March 1832, the court recessed for the term, and would not convene again for the following term until January 1833.
The Supreme Court's March 3, 1832 ruling ordered that Samuel Worcester and Elizur Butler be freed from prison. On March 17, Worcester's lawyers petitioned the Georgia court to release Worcester, but the court refused. Over the following months, Worcester's lawyers petitioned the newly elected governor of Georgia, Wilson Lumpkin, to offer an unconditional pardon, but Lumpkin declined on the basis that the federal government was overstepping its authority. At the same time, the federal government, under Secretary of War Lewis Cass, began an intensive campaign to secure a removal treaty with the Cherokee nation, which would render the Supreme Court decision and Worcester's continued political imprisonment inconsequential. On November 6, Lumpkin delivered his annual message to the Georgia state legislature, announcing he would continue to resist the Supreme Court's decision:
thumb|right|Wilson Lumpkin, Governor of Georgia, 1831-35
Eighteen days later, on November 24, the state of South Carolina issued an Ordinance of Nullification, a separate and unrelated attempt by a state to defy federal authority. This began a series of events known as the Nullification Crisis. In an effort to isolate Georgia from South Carolina, the Jackson administration changed course in their approach to the Worcester decision. Secretary of War Lewis Cass, U.S. Senator John Forsyth of Georgia, incoming Vice President Martin Van Buren, and Van Buren's political allies of the Albany Regency began to lobby Lumpkin to offer a pardon, citing the probability that a removal treaty with the Cherokees could be achieved once Worcester and Butler were released from prison. To sustain his states' rights position, Lumpkin stipulated that Worcester and Butler had to petition for the pardon with an admission they had violated state law. The two missionaries at first refused, because the Supreme Court decision had ruled they had not broken any law. The two decided to continue their appeal once the Supreme Court convened in early 1833.
The national situation began to deteriorate in December. On December 8, Andrew Jackson issued a Nullification Proclamation, denouncing nullification in South Carolina, declaring secession to be unconstitutional, and proclaiming the United States government would resort to force if South Carolina did not back down. Further entreaties by Georgia politicians and representatives of the federal government convinced Worcester and Butler of the risk to the Cherokee nation if Georgia were to join South Carolina's attempt at secession. Worcester and Butler began to reconsider their appeal to the Supreme Court.
On December 22, Georgia repealed the law that had put Worcester and Butler in prison, allowing them to petition for a pardon without having to take an oath to leave the state of Georgia or Cherokee land. On January 8, 1833, the missionaries petitioned for their pardon, but it did not contain an admission they had broken state law, and Lumpkin believed its wording was insulting to the state of Georgia. Representatives for both sides negotiated for a new letter to be drafted by the missionaries, which was delivered to Lumpkin the following day. In the final letter, Worcester and Butler appealed to the "magnanimity of the State" of Georgia to end their prison sentences. On January 14, Lumpkin issued a general proclamation, not a formal pardon. Worcester and Butler were freed from prison.
Two days later, on January 16, President Andrew Jackson sent a message to Congress requesting the military power to put down the South Carolina insurrection. This request would be granted in the form of the Force Bill. Worcester and Butler were criticized by supporters of the Nullification effort, accusing them of aiding Jackson's effort to inaugurate war against South Carolina.
On January 19, Worcester and Butler arrived back at New Echota, the capital of the Cherokee Nation. In February, they sent a letter to the Missionary Herald, explaining that their abandonment of the Supreme Court case was "not . . . from any change in our views, but on account of changing circumstances".
Aftermath
On December 29, 1835, members of the Cherokee nation signed the controversial removal treaty, the Treaty of New Echota, which was immediately protested by the large majority of the Cherokees. Samuel Worcester moved to the Cherokee nation's western Indian Territory in 1836, after removal had commenced. Worcester resumed his ministry, continued translating the Bible into Cherokee, and established the first printing press in that part of the United States, working with the Cherokee to publish their newspaper.
In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book The Supreme Court in United States History, Charles Warren asserted that the sequence of events in the aftermath of the Worcester case allowed the Supreme Court to go from its lowest point in history in late 1832, to its strongest position in fifteen years by early 1833. In 2000, Justice Stephen Breyer observed that the Supreme Court was an "obvious winner" in the case once its judgment was enforced, but the Cherokee nation was the "obvious loser" since the judgment did not benefit them in any way. Because Jackson proceeded with Cherokee removal, Worcester did not aid indigenous rights at the time. Removal of the Cherokee nation would begin just three years after Samuel Worcester and Elizur Butler were released from Georgia prison, and forced migration would commence via the Trail of Tears in 1838.
Worcester has been cited in several later opinions on the subject of tribal sovereignty in the United States. In 2022, the Court ruled on Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, a case that resulted from the Court's earlier decision in McGirt v. Oklahoma that the tribal lands in the eastern half of Oklahoma had never been deestablished by Congress, and as a result, crimes committed on tribal lands by Native Americans were considered to be covered by tribal and federal jurisdiction rather than the state. Castro-Huertra was decided to clarify that crimes committed by non-Native Americans on tribal lands would have simultaneous jurisdiction by both federal and state. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing the majority in Castro-Huetra, stated that "the Worcester-era understanding of Indian country as separate from the State was abandoned later in the 1800s", based on both United States v. McBratney and Draper v. United States.

From "World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson" ==> """
World-Wide Volkswagen Corp v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286 (1980), is a United States Supreme Court case involving strict products liability, personal injury and various procedural issues and considerations. The 1980 opinion, written by Justice Byron White, is included in the first-year civil procedure curriculum at nearly every American law school for its focus on personal jurisdiction.
Background
Accident
Harry and Kay Robinson purchased a new Audi 100 LS automobile from Seaway Volkswagen, Inc. in Massena, New York, in 1976. The following year, as Kay Robinson passed through Oklahoma on Interstate 44 en route to the Robinsons' new home in Arizona, the Audi was struck from the rear by a drunk driver in a 1971 Ford Torino. The impact of the collision itself did not directly injure any of the Robinsons, but the crash resulted in the Audi's doors jamming shut and a puncture in the car's gas tank. A fire then severely burned the trapped Kay Robinson and her two children riding in the Audi, Eva and Sam.
Lawsuit
The Robinsons did not bring a suit against Lloyd Hull, the drunk driver. He had no insurance or assets and was therefore judgment proof. The Robinsons claimed that a product defect in the car led to the injuries they sustained—specifically, the Audi's gas tank was located beneath the trunk, in an area that the Robinsons claimed was susceptible to being punctured and igniting in a rear-end collision. They brought suit against the automobile’s manufacturer (Audi), its importer (Volkswagen of America), its regional distributor (World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.), and its retailer dealer (Seaway Volkswagen).
The Robinsons' Oklahoma attorney brought the lawsuit in state court in Creek County, Oklahoma, the county in which the accident had occurred. Creek County was at that time known as home to some of the most plaintiff sympathetic juries in the country.  However, since the lawsuit met requirements for concurrent jurisdiction in both state and federal court, Audi and Volkswagen would have had the ability to ask for the case to be removed from state court in Creek County and taken directly to federal court. One of the factors which governs concurrent jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship, or whether a defendant and plaintiff are from the same state. In the case of multiple defendants, if one defendants' state citizenship matches the plaintiff's, concurrent federal jurisdiction does not apply and the case cannot be removed to federal court unless the case concerns a matter of federal law. It has therefore been stated that the reason the Robinsons' attorney added the New York regional distributor and New York dealership as defendants was to prevent Audi and Volkswagen from being able to remove the case from what was generally seen as a Creek County pro-plaintiffs' jury to what would be a federal court jury in Tulsa that might be more sympathetic to the car manufacturers' case.  The Robinsons had not yet completed a move to Arizona, so they were still considered to be legal residents of New York.
The Robinsons first sued only Volkswagen of America, World-Wide, and Seaway. They later amended the suit to include Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft (Volkswagen AG), the German parent company. A second amendment was included after they learned during formal discovery that Audi NSU Auto Union Aktiengesellschaft (Audi AG) was the manufacturing parent company rather than Volkswagen AG; they substituted Audi AG for Volkswagen AG.
When they were brought in as defendants in the case, World-Wide and Seaway claimed that Oklahoma’s exercise of personal or in personam jurisdiction over them would offend the limitations on states' jurisdiction imposed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; they asked to be removed from the suit. Audi and Volkswagen, which sold cars in the state of Oklahoma, did not attempt to assert that the Oklahoma state court had no jurisdiction over them.
Issue
Whether Seaway Volkswagen and Worldwide Volkswagen had sufficient minimum contacts with Oklahoma, such that these defendants would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Oklahoma state courts.
Lower courts' decisions
The United States Supreme Court excerpts the reasoning of the Oklahoma Supreme Court in affirming that Oklahoma's long-arm statute provides for jurisdiction over World Wide and Seaway. "...the product being sold and distributed by the petitioners [World-Wide and Seaway] is by its very design and purpose so mobile that petitioners can foresee its possible use in Oklahoma. This is especially true of the distributor [Seaway], who has the exclusive right to distribute such automobile in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The evidence presented below demonstrated that goods sold and distributed by the petitioners were used in the State of Oklahoma, and under the facts we believe it reasonable to infer, given the retail value of the automobile, that the petitioners derive substantial income from automobiles which from time to time are used in the State of Oklahoma. This being the case, we hold that under the facts presented, the trial court was justified in concluding that the petitioners derive substantial revenue from goods used or consumed in this State."World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286 (1980)
The emphasis on "substantial revenue" comes from the relevant long-arm statute, since repealed, stating that a court can exercise jurisdiction over persons (corporate or natural) who cause injury in Oklahoma and derive, "...substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered, in this state..."
The district court rejected World-Wide and Seaway's constitutional claim and reaffirmed that original ruling in denying petitioners’ motion for reconsideration.
Supreme Court decision
The United States Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court and agreed with World-Wide and Seaway that Oklahoma did not have jurisdiction over them.
The Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment limits the power of a state court to exercise personal or in personam jurisdiction against a nonresident defendant.  A state court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident only so long as there exist "minimum contacts" between the defendant and the forum state.
The court stated that the concept of minimum contacts can be seen to perform two related but distinguishable functions. It protects the defendant against the burdens of litigating in a distant or inconvenient forum and it acts to ensure that the States, through their courts, do not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system.
The 14th Amendment provides protection against inconvenient litigation, typically described in terms of “reasonableness” or “fairness”: “Does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” The relationship between the defendant and forum must be “reasonable.” The burden on the defendant is to be balanced against other factors, including the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief.
The due process clause “does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties or relations.” Even if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another state, even if the forum state has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy, and even if the forum state is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause may sometimes act to divest the state of its power to render a valid judgment.
The petitioners' contentions were deemed correct by the Supreme Court, which agreed that the two corporations did not have minimum contacts in Oklahoma, did not avail themselves of any of the privileges or benefits of Oklahoma law; Oklahoma therefore had no jurisdiction over the two companies.
The Robinson's counterclaim and Justice Brennan's dissenting opinion were based on foreseeability – a car sold in New York is mobile, and therefore it was foreseeable by World-Wide and Seaway that a car sold by them could subsequently lead to an injury in Oklahoma. The majority opinion of the Supreme Court rejected this argument, saying that foreseeability alone could not provide the basis for personal jurisdiction over a defendant and the two petitioning companies had no other contacts with Oklahoma.
Subsequent litigation
With World-Wide and Seaway unable to be held as defendants in the Robinsons' case against Audi and Volkswagen, the case now had diversity of citizenship and was concurrently eligible for both state and federal court. Audi and Volkswagen removed the case from Creek County into federal district court in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where a jury sided with the two car companies. The Tulsa jury indicated that they believed the speed of Lloyd Hull's car, rather than the Audi's gas tank, was responsible for the fire.

From "Wright v. Rockefeller" ==> """
Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52 (1964), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that in cases involving allegations of improper racial gerrymandering, where the evidence was "equally, or more, persuasive" that racial considerations had not motivated the State Legislature, the Court will give deference to the findings of the District Court..
 Factual and Procedural Background 
Appellants, a group of citizens and registered voters in the Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth Congressional Districts in Manhattan brought suit against New York state officials, including then Governor Nelson Rockefeller, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York challenging the constitutionality of the portion of New York's 1961 congressional apportionment statute which defined the four districts.376 U.S. at 53  The District Court permitted Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, who represented the Eighteenth District, along with several other New York County officials, to intervene as defendants supporting the constitutionality of the statute.  The appellants claimed that apportionment statute deprived them of rights guaranteed by the Due Process and Equal protection portions of the Fourteenth Amendment and by the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibit the government from denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.  Specifically, they claimed that the statute "establish[ed] irrational, discriminatory and unequal Congressional Districts in the County of New York and segregat[ed] eligible voters by race and place of origin."
The case was heard by a three judge panel of the District Court.  Appellants presented maps, statistics, and other evidence demonstrating that African-Americans and Puerto Ricans comprised 86.3 per cent of the Eighteenth District, 28.5 per cent of the Nineteenth District, 27.5 per cent of the Twentieth District, but only 5.1 per cent of the Seventeenth District.376 U.S. at 54  A majority of the District Court panel found that appellants had not made out their case.376 U.S. at 55  One judge concluded that "no proof was offered by any party that the specific boundaries created by [the statute] were drawn on racial lines or that the Legislature was motivated by considerations of race, creed or country or origin in creating the districts."  One judge dissented, viewing the evidence as "tantamount for all practical purposes, to a mathematical demonstration" that the legislation was "solely concerned with segregating" white voters from non-whites.376 U.S. at 57
 Court's Decision 
Four justices wrote opinions in this case.  Justice Black wrote for the majority, and was joined by 6 other justices, including Justice Harlan, who also wrote a concurring opinion.  Justices Douglas and Goldberg each wrote dissenting opinions, and each joined the others opinion.
The majority decision
The Court began with a recitation of the relevant factual and procedural background, and then turned to first question presented in the statement, whether "appellants sustained their burden of providing that the portion of [the statute] which delineates the boundaries of the Congressional districts in Manhattan Island segregates eligible voters by race and place of origin in violation [of the Constitution]."376 U.S. at 56  The Court accepted the findings of the majority of the District Court that the appellants failed to prove that the New York Legislature was either motivated by racial considerations or in fact drew the districts on racial lines.  The Court accepted that there may have been evidence which could have supported an inference that the Legislature was moved by racial considerations, but found that there was also evidence supporting the contrary inference that was "equally, or more, persuasive."376 U.S. at 56-57  The Court accepted the finding that appellants failed to demonstrate that the statute was "the product of a state contrivance to segregate on the basis of race or place of origin," and therefore upheld the District Court's decision.376 U.S. at 58
Harlan's concurring opinion
Justice Harlan joined the opinion of the Court, but wrote separately, in a paragraph long concurrence, to comment that he believed that this case was governed by entirely different principles than in Wesberry v. Sanders, a case that had also been decided that day.376 U.S. at 58-59, Harlan, J. concurring
Douglas' dissenting opinion
Justice Douglas dissented, arguing that the case raised a similar question to the issue raised in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, where racial gerrymandering was used to deprive African Americans on the right to vote.376 U.S. at 59, Douglas, J. dissenting  Douglas argued that though the right to vote was not being deprived, the redistricting was concentrating minority voters in particular districts and excluding them from others.
Douglas recited the relevant facts, and concluded that "[t]he record strongly suggests that these twists and turns producing an 11-sided, step-shaped boundary between the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Districts were made to bring into the Eighteenth District and keep out of the Seventeenth as many Negroes and Puerto Ricans as possible."376 U.S. at 60-61  Although he admitted that the District Court had not made such a finding, Justice Douglas concluded that, absent any rebuttal or challenge by the State, the only inference that could be drawn from the facts was that it was "not possible to say 'that race is irrelevant to districting.'"376 U.S. at 61, Douglas, J. dissenting, quoting oral argument transcript
Douglas next addressed the argument advanced by the intervening parties that the districting plan was beneficial to minorities, because it allowed minority politicians an advantage in heavily minority districts.  Douglas rejected this argument, referring to it as the theory of "separate but better off," and writing "[t]he fact that Negro political leaders find advantage in this nearly solid Negro and Puerto Rican district is irrelevant to our problem. Rotten boroughs were long a curse of democratic processes.  Racial boroughs are also at war with democratic standards."376 U.S. at 62 Douglas, J. dissenting
Finally, Douglas compared the situation in the Manhattan districts to the Electoral Register System that the British instituted in India, and was also used in Lebanon.376 U.S. at 63-67, Douglas, J. dissenting Under that system, constituencies were separated by religion.  Douglas wrote that "Racial electoral registers, like religious ones, have no place in a society that honors the Lincoln tradition — 'of the people, by the people, for the people.'"376 U.S. at 66, Douglas, J. dissenting  Such a system, Douglas argued, "is a divisive force in a community, emphasizing differences between candidates and voters that are irrelevant in the constitutional sense."
Goldberg's dissenting opinion
Justice Goldberg wrote a separate dissent, arguing that the appellants had satisfied their burden of establishing that district boundaries had been purposefully drawn on racial lines.376 U.S. at 67, Goldberg, J. dissenting  Goldberg rejected the conclusion that the District Court had found to the contrary.  The decision from the three-judge District Court contained a separate opinion for each, therefore, Goldberg argued that the District Court had made no findings of fact at all.376 U.S. at 68, Goldberg, J. dissenting  He then went on to discuss and criticize the constitutional standards applied by each of the District Court judges.  In this light, he argued that the majority’s grounds for their decision, i.e., accepting the findings and constitutional standards of the District Court, was meaningless and an abdication of the Supreme Court’s responsibilities.  Goldberg further stated that the appellants had made sufficient showings of racially discriminatory intent in the redistricting plan to pursue their case.

From "Wyeth v. Levine" ==> """
Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555 (2009), is a United States Supreme Court case holding that Federal regulatory approval of a medication does not shield the manufacturer from liability under state law.. 
 Facts 
Vermont jury trial
The plaintiff lost her hand to gangrene when she was injected with Phenergan, an anti-nausea drug made by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals.  She won a jury verdict in Vermont, under the theory (inter alia) that Wyeth had inadequately labeled the drug.
Phenergan's regulatory background
The trial record shows that the FDA first cleared injectable Phenergan for use in 1955. In 1973 and 1976, Wyeth submitted supplemental new drug applications, which the agency cleared after proposing labeling changes. Wyeth submitted a third supplemental application in 1981 in response to a new FDA rule governing drug labels. Over the next 17 years, Wyeth and the FDA intermittently corresponded about Phenergan's label. The most notable activity occurred in 1987, when the FDA suggested different warnings about the risk of arterial exposure, and in 1988, when Wyeth submitted revised labeling incorporating the proposed changes. The FDA did not respond. Instead, in 1996, it requested from Wyeth the labeling then in use and, without addressing Wyeth's 1988 submission, instructed it to "retain verbiage in [the] current label" regarding intra-arterial injection. After a few further changes to the labeling not related to intra-arterial injection, the FDA cleared Wyeth's 1981 application in 1998, instructing that Phenergan's final printed label "must be identical" to the approved package insert.
Wyeth's motion for judgment as a matter of law
Wyeth argued that this Vermont law was federally preempted because it was in "actual conflict [with] a specific FDA order" regarding drug labeling.  The trial court rejected this argument, as did the Supreme Court of Vermont, holding that the FDA requirements merely provide a floor, not a ceiling, for state regulation. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.
Issue
If a drug meets the labeling requirements of the FDA, does that give rise to federal preemption of state law regarding inadequate labeling? Wyeth presented two arguments in favor of FDA Preemption:
It is impossible for Wyeth to comply with both the state-law duties and federal labeling regulations, see Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta, since the latter forbids it from changing its label without FDA approval.
Permitting states to require stronger warnings creates an unacceptable "obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress," Hines v. Davidowitz, because it substitutes a lay jury's decision about drug labeling for the expert judgment that Congress sought to entrust with drug labeling decisions when it created the FDA.
Holding
Justice John Paul Stevens, writing on behalf of a 6-3 court, rejected both of Wyeth's arguments.  In other words, the Vermont law was not preempted (or overruled) by FDA regulations; thus, the plaintiff could argue her case before a state court jury.
In 2019, the issue was revisited in Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp. v. Albrecht. The Supreme Court found in that case that the appellant had demonstrated sufficient evidence to prove that the FDA had considered and rejected, and thus preempted, an addition to a warning label for Fosamax.
Reasoning
Questions of federal preemption "must be guided by two cornerstones of our pre-emption jurisprudence":
"First, 'the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case.' Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 485 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96, 103 (1963)."
"Second, '[i]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those in which Congress has "legislated in a field which the States have traditionally occupied, [we] start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress." '  Lohr, 518 U.S., at 485 (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218 230 (1947))"
In its first argument, Wyeth is incorrect that relabeling the drug to conform to Vermont law would necessarily have violated federal labeling regulations.
Although a manufacturer generally needs FDA approval before changing a drug label, the agency's "changes being effected" (CBE) regulation permits certain unilateral labeling changes that improve drug safety. Wyeth's misreading of this regulation is based on the misunderstanding that the FDA, rather than the manufacturer, bears primary responsibility for drug labeling. It is a central premise of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the FDA's regulations that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times. Pp. 11–16.
In its second argument, Wyeth is incorrect that permitting states to require stronger warnings would interfere with Congress' purpose of entrusting an expert agency with drug labeling decisions because it was not Congress's intent, in writing the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, to preempt state-law failure to warn actions.
Wyeth's argument misconstrues the intent of congress behind the FDCA. Congress did not intend the FDCA to pre-empt state-law failure-to-warn actions.
Wyeth's argument also misconstrues the capacity of agencies to preempt state law, as Wyeth's argument relies on the preamble to a 2006 FDA regulation declaring that state-law failure-to-warn claims threaten the FDA's statutorily prescribed role. Although an agency regulation with the force of law can pre-empt conflicting state requirements, this case involves no such regulation but merely an agency's assertion that state law is an obstacle to achieving its statutory objectives. Where, as here, Congress has not authorized a federal agency to pre-empt state law directly, the weight this Court accords the agency's explanation of state law's impact on the federal scheme depends on its thoroughness, consistency, and persuasiveness, e.g. Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134. Under this standard, the FDA's 2006 preamble does not merit deference: It is inherently suspect in light of the FDA's failure to offer interested parties notice or opportunity for comment on the pre-emption question; it is at odds with the available evidence of Congress' purposes; and it reverses the FDA's own longstanding position that state law is a complementary form of drug regulation without providing a reasoned explanation.
Concurrence
Justice Breyer noted that, while the issue was not present here, the FDA may create regulations that pre-empt state law tort claims.
Concurrence only in judgment
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately, concurring only in the judgment. He criticized the majority for implicitly endorsing a "far-reaching implied pre-emption doctrine" where the Court can invalidate state laws based on perceived conflicts with federal statutes by extrapolating from evidence not found in the text of the statute.
Dissent
Justice Samuel Alito dissented and was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia. He disagreed with the Court's holding that a jury, rather than the FDA, is ultimately responsible for regulating warning labels for prescription drugs. He argued this is incompatible with Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., which established the principles of conflict preemption.

From "Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education" ==> """
Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 476 U.S. 267 (1986), was a case before the United States Supreme Court.  It is the seminal case for the "strong-basis-in-evidence standard" for affirmative action programs.. 
Background
In response to racial tension in a community and its schools, the Board of Education and the teachers union in Jackson, Michigan added a "layoff provision" to their collective bargaining agreement; it required that in the event of layoffs, "teachers with the most seniority ... shall be retained, except that at no time will there be a greater percentage of minority personnel laid off than the current percentage of minority personnel employed at the time of the layoff."  This provision was designed to preserve the effects of a hiring policy whose goal had been to increase the percentage of minority teachers in the school system.  When layoffs became necessary, the board adhered to the provision, with the result that certain nonminority teachers were laid off while minority teachers with less seniority were retained.
Procedural history
The displaced nonminority teachers sued in federal court, alleging violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court dismissed the teachers' claims, holding that the racial preferences were permissible as an attempt to remedy societal discrimination by providing role models for minority schoolchildren. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed on similar grounds.
Decision
The United States Supreme Court reversed. Although unable to agree on an opinion, five members of the court agreed that the layoffs were in violation of the equal protection clause. It was also agreed by five members of the court that the equal protection clause does not require a public employer's voluntary affirmative action plan to be preceded by a formal finding that the employer has committed discriminatory acts in the past.
Judgment of the court
Justice Powell announced the judgment of the court. He expressed the view that
(1) any governmental classification or preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must be justified by a compelling governmental interest, and the means chosen by the government to effectuate its purpose must be narrowly tailored to the achievement of that goal
(2) such means are subject to strict scrutiny and must be tested by a standard more stringent than reasonableness
(3) a school board's interest in providing minority faculty role models for its minority students in an attempt to alleviate the effects of societal discrimination is insufficient to justify racially discriminatory practices in the hiring and layoff of teachers
(4) a public employer like the Board must ensure that, before it embarks on an affirmative-action program, it has convincing evidence that remedial action is warranted. That is, it must have sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that there has been prior discrimination"Wygant, 476 U.S. at 276.
(5) the existence of societal discrimination, without more, is too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified legal remedy
(6) in order to remedy the effects of prior racial discrimination, a state may implement a race-based plan under which innocent parties are called upon to bear some of the burden, provided that their share of the burden is relatively light and diffused among society generally
(7) the fact that a race-based layoff plan has been approved by the more senior members of a labor union does not operate to waive the constitutional rights of the most junior nonminority members, who would bear the entire burden of the plan
(8) although the equal protection clause does not require layoffs to be based on strict seniority, it does require the state to meet a heavy burden of justification when it implements a layoff plan based on race
(9) this burden is not met where the plan is not sufficiently narrowly tailored to accomplish otherwise legitimate purposes, and where less intrusive means, such as the adoption of hiring goals, are available to accomplish similar purposes
Concurring in part and in the judgment
Justice O'Connor stated that the layoff provision was not narrowly tailored to achieve its asserted purpose, on the ground that it was designed to safeguard a hiring goal that was tied to the percentage of minority students in the school district, not to the percentage of qualified minority teachers within the labor pool, and that such a hiring goal itself had no relation to the remedying of employment discrimination.
Concurring in the judgment
Justice White expressed the view that none of the interests asserted by the board, singly or together, justified the racially discriminatory layoff policy where none of the retained minority teachers was shown to be a victim of any racial discrimination, and that the layoff policy had the same impermissible effect as one that would integrate a work force by discharging whites and hiring blacks until the latter comprised a suitable percentage.
Dissents
Justice Marshall expressed the view
(1) that the case should have been remanded for further findings of fact as to whether the board's remedial action was warranted
(2) that under the apparent circumstances of the case, the state purpose of preserving the integrity of a hiring policy which sought to achieve diversity and stability for the benefit of all students was sufficient to satisfy the demands of the Constitution
(3) that the layoff provision was a permissible means of achieving this purpose because it allocated the impact of an unavoidable burden, necessitated by external economic conditions, proportionately between two racial groups, and was arrived at through the process of collective bargaining
Justice Stevens expressed the view that
(1) the decision to include more minority teachers in the school system served the valid public purpose of seeking multiethnic representation on the faculty, regardless of whether the board of education was guilty of past racial discrimination
(2) the policy was adopted with fair procedures and given a narrow breadth
(3) it transcended the harm to laid-off nonminority teachers
Analysis
Given the lack of a majority in Wygant, commentators have paired Justice Powell's plurality with Justice O'Connor's concurrence to find three potential conclusions of the case:Retelling the Story of Affirmative Action: Reflections on a Decade of Federal Jurisprudence in the Public Workplace, 89 Cal. L. Rev. 59, 85 (2001)
(1) employers need not evidence prior discrimination rising to the level of a constitutional or statutory violation before implementing voluntary affirmative action programs
(2) evidence of prior discrimination rising to the level of a prima facie statutory violation will provide a "sufficient basis" for implementing remedial programs
(3) statistical evidence of minority underrepresentation in an employer's ranks is highly relevant to a finding of remedial need

From "Wyoming v. Colorado" ==> """
Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U.S. 419 (1922) is a set of court cases, all dealing with water distribution from the Laramie River. A petition for rehearing was granted, which revised the original decision. A motion to dismiss was later denied.
Background
When a dispute arises between two states, the case is filed for original jurisdiction with the United States Supreme Court. This is one of the very limited circumstances where the court acts with original jurisdiction, e.g. a trial court. In all other cases the Court acts as the highest level appellate court in the United States.
The state of Wyoming brought an action against the state of Colorado to prevent the diversion of a stream system. Wyoming claimed the doctrine of prior appropriation granted them superior rights to the stream water, as they claimed the water first, and that Colorado's proposed diversion would leave them with an insufficient supply of water. 
Opinion of the Court
The Court upheld Wyoming's prior appropriation water rights, preventing Colorado's proposed diversion of the stream system as originally planned. However, the Court allowed Colorado to divert a lesser amount of water, as long as it did not interfere with Wyoming's prior water usage. After in depth fact-finding of the exact amount of water used by Wyoming, the court determined that Colorado could divert no more than  per year of water from the interstate stream system.

From "Wyoming v. Houghton" ==> """
Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U.S. 295 (1999), is a United States Supreme Court case which held that absent exigency, the warrantless search of a passenger's container capable of holding the object of a search for which there is probable cause is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, because it is justified under the automobile exception as an effect of the car.. 
Background
In Houghton, the Supreme Court was confronted with the question of whether the scope of a vehicle exception search included a passenger's purse. The car had been stopped by a police officer for a faulty brake light, and the driver was promptly observed to have a syringe in his shirt pocket. He admitted he used it to shoot up. A backup police car soon arrived, and the passengers were ordered out of the car. Ms. Houghton gave a false name. While looking through her purse, an officer found her driver's license and, thus, her real name. Continuing the search, the officer found a syringe with 60 ccs of methamphetamine. Looking at her arms, he saw fresh needle tracks. She was arrested.In her purse, there were two separate containers in which drugs and drug paraphernalia were found. She disclaimed any ownership interest in one of them.
The trial court denied her motion to suppress and she was convicted. On appeal, the Wyoming Supreme Court reversed because the officers lacked probable cause to search her purse simply based on the driver's possession of a syringe.
 Opinion of the Court 
The Supreme Court reversed, 6–3. Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, stated that all Fourth Amendment inquiries look first to the intent of the Framers of the Constitution. If that does not provide an answer, then "we must evaluate the search or seizure under traditional standards of reasonableness by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual's privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests."
Looking to Carroll v. United States, the first automobile exception case from 1925, the Court found there that the Framers would hold that the whole car could be searched if there was probable cause to believe it contained contraband. Likewise, the Court opined in United States v. Ross that the Carroll doctrine permitted searches of all containers found in a vehicle there was probable cause to search.Houghton, 143 L.Ed.2d at 415, quoting Ross, 456 U.S. at 820 n. 26:
Going one step further, however, the Court held that even if the historical perspective was not enough, a "balancing of the relative interests weigh decidedly in favor of allowing searches of passenger's belongings" because of the reduced expectation of privacy in and the mobility of automobiles. Also, passengers in cars are more likely engaged in a common enterprise with the driver and "have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing." Also, their proximity enables them "to hide contraband in [each other's] belongings as readily as in other containers in the car ... perhaps even surreptitiously, without the passenger's knowledge or permission." While these factors will not always be present, "the balancing of interests must be conducted with an eye to the generality of cases." Thus, specific probable cause to the container was not required.
 Dissent 
Justice Stevens, the author of Ross, dissented with Justices Souter and Ginsburg. He found that precedent did not dictate the result, and he noted that Ross "categorically rejected the notion that the scope of a warrantless search of a vehicle might be 'defined by the nature of the container in which the contraband is secreted. ... Rather, it is defined by the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be found.'" Since there was no dispute there was no probable cause to believe that Houghton's purse contained contraband, the search should have been suppressed.
The dissenters also disagreed with an effective presumption that persons in a vehicle would be holding each other's evidence or contraband.
Finally, the dissenters disagreed with elevating law enforcement interests over privacy concerns and that the "two-step Fourth Amendment approach wherein the privacy and governmental interests at stake must be considered only if 18th-century common law 'yields no answer'" because nothing cited by the Court mandated that approach and the Court did address the contemporary privacy interests involved. Indeed, United States v. Di Re dictated that Carroll did not permit a search of a passenger where there was no probable cause.

From "Yakus v. United States" ==> """
Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414 (1944), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court.  which upheld congressional power to fetter judicial review and to delegate broad and flexible law-making power to an administrative agency in this constitutional challenge to the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942. The wartime anti-inflation measure, intended to expedite price control enforcement, conferred on the federal district courts jurisdiction over violations of Office of Price Administration (OPA) regulations made under the act. But judicial power to consider the constitutionality of such regulations was excepted. Congress specified that challenges to their validity be initially reviewed under stringent time limitations by the OPA and on appeal exclusively by a special Article III tribunal in the District of Columbia—the Emergency Court of Appeals—and thereafter by the Supreme Court.
Background
Massachusetts meat dealer Albert Yakus, criminally prosecuted for violating the wholesale beef price ceiling, had failed to launch a procedurally difficult pre-enforcement attack on the OPA regulations constitutionality and was barred from collateral challenges during his trial. The Court affirmed his conviction, holding that “so long as there is an opportunity … for judicial review which satisfies the demands of due process,” the bifurcated enforcement and constitutional proceedings were permissible (p. 444). In dissent, Wiley Rutledge, with Frank Murphy, asserted that once Congress conferred jurisdiction, it could not compel the district judges to ignore Marbury v. Madison or violate the Constitution by enforcing the criminal sanctions, a statute, and regulations devoid of due process. 
A Yakus‐like incontestability provision reached the Court in Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States (1978).. Statutory construction facilitated evasion of the constitutional issues, but Lewis Powell, concurring, questioned the validity of Yakus except as an exercise of war powers. Nevertheless, modern environmental legislation contains judicial review schemes similar to that upheld in Yakus. 
Justice Roberts, who also dissented, embraced the non-delegation doctrine argument and held that the OPA had exercised unconstitutionally delegated congressional powers. The New Deal Court majority reacted by stipulating that statutory standards need only be sufficiently defined to permit ascertainment of the administrative agency's obedience to the congressional will.
Implications for Administrative Law
The Supreme Court's decision of Yakus v. United States was a major decision in determining the development of American administrative law.  in particular, Yakus addressed the misunderstood nondelegation doctrine.  In the majority opinion, Chief Justice Stone argued that an administrative agency could correct a problem of delegation if it limited its own power: 
The standards prescribed by the present Act, with the aid of the "statement of the considerations" required to be made by the Administrator, are sufficiently definite and precise to enable Congress, the courts and the public to ascertain whether the administrator, in fixing the designated prices, has conformed to those standards . . . Hence we are unable to find in them an unauthorized delegation of legislative power.Yakus, 321 U.S. at 426. 
Thus, Yakus held that an administrative agency could "save" an otherwise unconstitutional delegation of power through a narrowing construction that constrains the agency's own discretion.  This would become a key principle in American constitutional law and would be followed by lower courts in striking down challenges to laws based on the nondelegation doctrine for the next fifty years.  This Yakus principle was logically flawed however: how could an administrative agency itself cure a problem of delegation?  If the problem of delegation is one of excessive legislative power transferred to the executive branch, then the actual delegation problem happens at the time of the passage of the statute—the act of an executive agency limiting that power is too late and does not correct the problem (it really only limits the problem).  As some say, allowing the agency to correct a delegation problem is liking locking the barn doors after all the horses have already escaped.  
The Supreme Court finally came to this conclusion in Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc..  In so doing, Justice Scalia denied that the Supreme Court had ever adopted such a stance on constitutional law: "We have never suggested that an agency can cure an unlawful delegation of legislative power by adopting in its discretion a limiting construction of the statute."  Thus, in striking down its previous jurisprudence, the Supreme Court seems to have forgotten about its holding in Yakus.

From "Yamashita v. Hinkle" ==> """
Yamashita v. Hinkle, 260 U.S. 199 (1922), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court that upheld the constitutionality of the state of Washington's Alien Land Law.. The law prohibited Asians from owning property. Washington's attorney general maintained that in order for Japanese people to fit in, their "marked physical characteristics" would have to be destroyed, that "the Negro, the Indian and the Chinaman" had already demonstrated assimilation was not possible for them. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case, brought by Takuji Yamashita, and affirmed this race-based prohibition, citing its immediately prior issued decision in Takao Ozawa v. United States. Ozawa had upheld the constitutionality of barring anyone other than "free white persons" and "persons of African nativity or ... descent" to naturalize, and affirmed the racial classifications of previous court decisions.
Washington's Alien Land Law would not be repealed until 1966.

From "Yamataya v. Fisher" ==> """
Yamataya v. Fisher, 189 U.S. 86 (1903), popularly known as the Japanese Immigrant Case, is a Supreme Court of the United States case about the federal government's power to exclude and deport certain classes of alien immigrants under the Immigration Act of 1891. The Supreme Court held that the courts may not interfere with a pending deportation unless the administrative hearing was unfair. However, deportation procedures are subject to constitutional scrutiny, under the Due Process Clause.Howard L. Bens, "The Deportation of Aliens," University of Pennsylvania Law Review and American Law Register 68, no. 2 (1920), 111.Alexander Aleinikoff, "Federal Regulation of Aliens and the Constitution," The American Journal of International Law 83, no. 4, 864.
The case was the first time that the Supreme Court allowed judicial review of a procedural due process claim.Hiroshi Motomura, "The Curious Evolution of Immigration Law: Procedural Surrogates for Substantive Constitutional Rights," Columbia Law Review 92, no. 7 (1992), 1637.
 Background 
The passing of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 restricted Chinese immigration to the United States but also provided for the deportation of Chinese immigrants who entered the United States in violation of the exclusion laws.Torrie Hester, "Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904," Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 12.1 In 1892, Congress passed the Geary Act which significantly expanded deportation under Chinese exclusion by introducing a system of residence certificates for all laborers of Chinese descent.Torrie Hester, "Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904," Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 12. Laborer who did not have a certificate at a deportation hearing would be deported. The Immigration Act of 1882 allowed for the exclusion and deportation of immigrants if they were immoral, criminal, mentally defective, unable to support themselves.Torrie Hester, "Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904," Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 13. In 1891, Congress extended the federal government's power to deport immigrants by adding categories of excludable and deportable immigrants to include idiots, the insane, paupers, and polygamists and those likely to become a public charge and those convicted of a felony or some other crimes or suffering from contagious diseases.Torrie Hester, "Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904," Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 14. In 1903, Congress passed another general immigration act, which added anarchists and political radicals to the list of both excludable and deportable immigrants.
General immigration deportations were heard before a Board of Special Inquiry staffed by three immigration officers. Appeals went to a Board of Special Inquiry and then to the Secretary of the department that controlled the Bureau of Immigration.Torrie Hester, "Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904," Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 15.
Case
Kaoru Yamataya was a fifteen-year-old pregnant girl from Japan when she landed in Seattle on July 11, 1901.Four days after her arrival, immigration authorities arrested and detained Yamataya on the grounds that she had entered the country illegally and was likely to become a public charge.Torrie Hester, "Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904," Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 23. The 1891 Immigration Act excluded any immigrant who was deemed likely to become a public charge. On July 26, 1901, a Board of Special Inquiry of three immigration officials convened to hear her case and found Yamataya deportable. Yamatya appealed her deportation through the court and eventually, her case was heard by the US Supreme Court. While awaiting the outcome of her case, Yamataya had a baby boy who died of pneumonia two months later. In addition, the man who had accompanied her, Masataro Yamataya, was tried and found not guilty of bringing a woman into the country for immoral purposes.
Argument
Yamataya's appeal, argued by Harold Preston, used three key arguments:
Since the Immigration Act of 1891 "did not explicitly provide for due process," the act was unconstitutional.
The appeals process for deportations went to the Secretary of Labor, whose decision was final and not reviewable in court.
The immigration agents denied Yamataya her Fifth Amendment rights of due process as the evidence against her was "garbled, incomplete, and in many respects misleading and untrue;" the hearing was conducted in English, which she did not speak, and she was investigated without her having access to a legal counsel or having a chance to show that she was not likely to become a public charge.
 Decision 
Justice Harlan gave the opinion of the court and dismissed Yamataya's appeal. The Supreme Court upheld the law although it had no explicit provisions for due process. The Court did not discuss whether the exclusion and deportation of a certain class of immigrants violated any constitutional rights. Justice Harlan wrote that an act of Congress "must be taken to be constitutional unless the contrary plainly and palpably appears.".
The Supreme Court also held that the appeals process under the law was constitutional. While the appeals process was not reviewable by the courts, the Court found that the immigration law still provided sufficient trial and appellate tribunals. It agreed with the government's assertion of administrative competency by holding that the investigations and actions of the executive offices in the deportation process were not "subject to judicial review."Torrie Hester, "Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904," Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 24.
Additionally, the Supreme Court upheld Yamataya's deportation and ruled that the deportation hearings met Fifth Amendment due process rights, as the executive hearing was found to
have been in front of immigration agents and to meet the standard of due process. It was also held that even a hearing that an immigrant cannot understand was not a violation of their Fifth Amendment due process rights. For Yamataya, even if the hearing was conducted in English and so she could not understand the proceedings against her, Harlan wrote that "was her misfortune, and constitutes no reason… for the intervention of the courts by habeas corpus."Yamataya, 189 U.S. at 102. However, the Supreme Court argued that if a person was deported without a hearing, Fifth Amendment due process would be violated and so it provided some ability to go through the courts.
Significance
While Yamataya was ordered to be deported back to Japan, the case significantly altered the appeals process for deportations in the United States. The ruling effectively created an appeals process in deportations under general immigration law. While immigrants could not challenge the outcome of deportation hearings in the courts and judicial system, they could challenge the legitimacy of the procedures.Torrie Hester, "Protection, Not Punishment: Legislative and Judicial formation of U.S. Deportation Policy, 1882-1904," Journal of American Ethnic History 30, no. 1 (2010), 25. If their procedural due process rights had been violated, immigrants were able to appeal their deportations in the courts. That was a significant shift in deportation appeals process, as individuals had an opportunity to appeal their deportation through the courts, which had been unavailable before the case.
For 50 years, the Supreme Court decisions would continue to use a procedural due process requirement but refuse to overturn government decisions in both exclusion and deportation contexts.Hiroshi Motomura, "The Curious Evolution of Immigration Law: Procedural Surrogates for Substantive Constitutional Rights," Columbia Law Review 92, no. 7 (1992), 1638. The courts remained reluctant to hear any substantive due process constitutional challenges to both the admission and deportation categories established by Congress.Hiroshi Motomura, "The Curious Evolution of Immigration Law: Procedural Surrogates for Substantive Constitutional Rights," Columbia Law Review 92, no. 7 (1992), 1639.

From "Yarborough v. Alvarado" ==> """
Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652 (2004), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court declined to overturn a state court's conclusion that a minor was not in custody for Miranda purposes during his police interview. Michael Alvarado helped his friend Paul Soto steal a truck in Santa Fe Springs, California. The truck owner was killed by Soto during the robbery and Alvarado was convicted of second-degree murder for his role in the crime. The evidence for Alvarado's conviction was primarily based on statements given by Alvarado during a two-hour police interrogation that occurred when Alvarado's parents brought him to the police station. Alvarado was 17 years old and was not read his Miranda rights before questioning. During Alvarado's murder trial in a state court, motions to suppress the statements given by Alvarado were denied on the ground that Alvarado was not in police custody at the time of the interrogation and thus did not have to be read his Miranda rights. Alvarado appealed his conviction, claiming that the determination that he was not in custody was incorrect because the courts did not take his age into account.
In a split decision, the Supreme Court declined to overturn the state court's conclusion about custody because it was not objectively incorrect..  The Court noted that there was no precedent that required the use of age in determining whether someone is in police custody (this would change in 2011 with J.D.B. v. North Carolina, which held that age is relevant to determining if someone is in custody).  The case has been cited in subsequent Supreme Court decisions as precedent for providing state courts with latitude in making decisions about general or broad rules.
Background
Crime and investigation
235px|thumb|Santa Fe Springs, the location of the murder.
The respondent Michael Alvarado agreed to help his friend Paul Soto steal a truck in the parking lot of a shopping mall in Santa Fe Springs, California. Soto pulled out a gun and approached the driver of the truck, demanding the keys, while Alvarado hid by the driver's side door. The driver refused and was shot and killed by Soto. Afterwards, Alvarado helped hide the gun. Los Angeles County Sheriff's detective Cheryl Comstock led the investigation of the crime. During the investigation Comstock contacted Alvarado's parents, saying that she wished to speak with Alvarado. Alvarado's parents brought him to the police station to be interviewed. Comstock brought Alvarado into an interview room and questioned him for two hours. Alvarado's parents asked to be present during the interview but were not allowed in by police. Alvarado admitted during questions that he had helped his friend try to steal the truck and that he had helped hide the gun.
Before custodial interrogations, police are required to give suspects a Miranda warning that informs suspects of their legal rights during interrogation. However, Alvarado was not given a Miranda warning at any time during questioning.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Opinion) p. 7 This would form part of the basis for Alvarado's legal defense.
Trial and conviction
The State of California charged Alvarado and his friend with first-degree murder and attempted robbery. Alvarado attempted to suppress his statements given during the Comstock interview on the basis that he was not read his Miranda rights. The trial court denied the motion on the basis that Alvarado was not in police custody at the time he gave his statement. Alvarado was subsequently convicted,Yarborough v. Alvarado (Opinion) p. 5 primarily based on statements Alvarado made during his police interrogation.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Opinion) p. 5 Alvarado's conviction was reduced by the trial judge to second-degree murder for his comparatively minor role in the offense. The California Courts of Appeal affirmed the conviction and agreed that Alvarado was not in custody.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Opinion) p. 5 The Supreme Court of California declined discretionary review.
Much of Alvarado's trial focused on whether Alvarado was in custody or not during his police interview. According to Thompson v. Keohane, to determine whether someone is in custody the courts apply a reasonable person test: whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave or not.Applying an objective test to resolve the "in custody" question, the court asked whether "a reasonable person would feel he was not free to leave and break off police questioning." Thompson v. Keohane (Opinion)
Petition for habeas corpus
After his conviction, Alvarado filed for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that the custody analysis was incorrect because the court had not considered Alvarado's age in its reasonable person test. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a federal court can grant habeas corpus to a person held due to a state court judgment if the state court judgement "resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States".110 STAT. 1219 Alvarado's habeas corpus petition thus depended on demonstrating that the state court's custody determination was more than debatable, but objectively incorrect.
The United States District Court for the Central District of California agreed that the state court rulings were correct,Alvarado v. Hickman (Opinion) p. 8 however the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. The Court of Appeals held that the state court made a mistake in not accounting for Alvarado's youth and inexperience when evaluating custody.Alvarado v. Hickman (Opinion) p. 18–19
Oral argument
left|150px|thumb|The interior of the United States Supreme Court Building, where oral arguments take place.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted early in the oral argument that the case presented two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Oral Argument) 2:40 California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age as a factor in custody analysis.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Oral Argument) 3:20 Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary because he thought it obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Oral Argument) 4:40 John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all peopleYarborough v. Alvarado (Oral Argument) 24:30 and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Oral Argument) 31:25
Tara K. Allen, arguing for Alvarado, claimed that the state court's decision was objectively unreasonable because they did not consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the investigation as required by Thompson v. Keohane.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Oral Argument) 44:40"The ultimate question"--requiring a "totality of the circumstances" assessment--"is a matter for independent federal determination. Thompson v. Keohane (Opinion) Specifically, the considered circumstances of custody were not total because Alvarado's age was not considered. Associate Justice Antonin Scalia responded by saying that, according to Thompson v. Keohane, custody is an objective testOnce the scene is set and the players' lines and actions are reconstructed, the court must apply an objective test to resolve "the ultimate inquiry": "[was] there a 'formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement' of the degree associated with a formal arrest." Thompson v. Keohane (Opinion) and subjective factors like characteristics of the individual do not matter.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Oral Argument) 46:20
 Opinion of the Court 
150px|thumb|Justice Kennedy, the author of the Court's opinion.
Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Opinion) p. 10 Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told he was free to leave, and Alvarado's parents were not allowed to be present during the interview.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Opinion) p. 11 Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Opinion) p. 10–11 The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.
Central to the reversal of the Ninth Circuit was the fact that the state court did not take into account Alvarado's age and experience with law enforcement in the custody analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The Court held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Opinion) p.12 Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Opinion) p. 13
O'Connor's concurrence
Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote a concurrence that agreed with the finding that the state court's decision was reasonable.Yarborough v. Alvarado (O'Connor Concurrence) p. 1 However, O'Connor held that there could be cases in which age would be relevant to custody analysis. This would be affirmed by the Court in 2011 in J.D.B. v. North Carolina.J.D.B., v. North Carolina (Opinion) p. 1
Dissent
150px|thumb|Justice Breyer, the author of the opinion for the dissent
Associate Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg joined. Breyer disagreed with the majority's holding that fair-minded jurists could disagree on whether Alvarado was in custody, holding that the facts compelled the single conclusion that Alvarado was in custody.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Dissent) p. 1 Breyer held that the actions the police did not do, such as arrest Alvarado or threaten him, were not as important as what the police did do.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Dissent) p. 4 Specifically, the police had Alvarado's parents bring him to the police station, brought Alvarado to an interrogation room, kept his parents out, and questioned him for two hours.
In the matter of Alvarado's age, Breyer found that it was relevant to the custody analysis.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Dissent) p. 5 Further, Breyer held that nothing in the law prevents a judge from including age in the custody analysis. Breyer called the discussion of experience with law enforcement misleading; while experience with law enforcement can be difficult to determine, Breyer noted that Alvarado's age was a known objective fact.Yarborough v. Alvarado (Dissent) p. 7
Reception
The case received both positive and negative reception in scholarly publications.
Support
A note published in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported the decision on procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court. The note argued that establishing such broad legal precedent was outside the bounds of the authority of the Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court was right to reverse.Yarborough v. Alvarado: At the Crossroads of the "Unreasonable Application" Provision of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and the Consideration of Juvenile Status in Custodial Determinations p. 895 Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.Yarborough v. Alvarado: At the Crossroads of the "Unreasonable Application" Provision of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and the Consideration of Juvenile Status in Custodial Determinations p. 896
Criticism
Berry Feld, professor at University of Minnesota Law School, wrote: "the Court's decision ... treated juveniles as the functional equals of adults during interrogation. Over the past quarter-century, developmental psychological research consistently has emphasized adolescents' inability to understand or exercise Miranda rights".Police Interrogation of Juveniles: An Empirical Study of Policy and Practice p. 314 Paul Holland, professor at Seattle University School of Law, wrote that "the assumptions Justice Kennedy made in Alvarado are inapplicable to the schoolhouse context ... considering the age of a student-suspect questioned at school, would not present a significant risk of compromising the clarity the Court has sought to provide law enforcement. Officers questioning students at school are well aware of the students' status as minors".Schooling Miranda: Policing Interrogation in the Twenty-First Century Schoolhouse p. 81–82
Role in subsequent decisions
Leeway granted to state courts
Yarborough v. Alvarado has been cited in subsequent Supreme Court decisions as precedent for providing state courts leeway in reaching case by case determinations for general rules.Carey v. Musladin (Kennedy Concurrence)Knowles v. Mirzayance (Opinion) p.11Harrington v. Richter (Opinion) p. 11
J.D.B. v. North Carolina
Though the Court rejected the argument that its previous holdings supported using age in the custody analysis, the Court did not rule against the use of age.J.D.B., v. North Carolina (Syllabus) p. 3Argument preview: Youth and Miranda rights In 2011 the Court clarified in J.D.B. v. North Carolina, ruling that a child's age is relevant to custody analysis. J.D.B. was a 13-year-old student who was interrogated at school by an investigator, a uniformed police officer, and school officials regarding a series of robberies. J.D.B. confessed to committing the robberies. He was not given a Miranda warning during the interrogation.  Motions to suppress J.D.B.'s statements at trial were denied on the ground that J.D.B. was not in custody. Age was not used as a factor in the custody determination. The Supreme Court found that J.D.B.'s age should have been considered in the custody analysis and instructed the lower court to make a new finding on custody while taking age into account.

From "Yasui v. United States" ==> """
Yasui v. United States, 320 U.S. 115 (1943), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding the constitutionality of curfews used during World War II when they were applied to citizens of the United States.. The case arose out of the implementation of Executive Order 9066 by the U.S. military to create zones of exclusion along the West Coast of the United States, where Japanese Americans were subjected to curfews and eventual removal to relocation centers. This Presidential order followed the attack on Pearl Harbor that brought America into World War II and inflamed the existing anti-Japanese sentiment in the country.
In their decision, the Supreme Court held that the application of curfews against citizens is constitutional. As a companion case to Hirabayashi v. United States, both decided on June 21, 1943, the court affirmed the conviction of U.S.-born Minoru Yasui. The court remanded the case to the district court for sentencing as the lower court had determined the curfew was not valid against citizens, but Yasui had forfeited his citizenship by working for the Japanese consulate. The Yasui and Hirabayashi decisions, along with the later Ex parte Endo and Korematsu v. United States decisions, determined the legality of the curfews and relocations during the war. In the 1980s, new information was used to vacate the conviction of Yasui.
Background
On September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded neighboring Poland, starting World War II. After two years of combat neutrality, the United States was drawn into the war as an active participant after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to fears of a fifth column composed of Japanese-Americans by issuing Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942. This executive order authorized the military to create zones of exclusion, which were then used to relocate predominantly those of Japanese heritage from the West Coast to internment camps inland. On March 23, 1942, General John L. DeWitt, commander of the Western Defense Command, set restrictions on aliens and Japanese-Americans including a curfew from 8:00 pm to 6:00 am.
Minoru Yasui was born in 1916 in Hood River, Oregon, where he graduated from high school in 1933. He then graduated from the University of Oregon in 1937, and that college’s law school in 1939. Yasui, U.S. Army reservist, then began working at the Japanese Consulate in Chicago, Illinois, in 1940, remaining there until December 8, 1941, when he then resigned and returned to Hood River. On March 28, 1942, he deliberately broke the military implemented curfew in Portland, Oregon, by walking around the downtown area and then presenting himself at a police station after 11:00 pm in order to test the curfew’s constitutionality.
On June 12, 1942, Judge James Alger Fee of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon began presiding over the non-jury trial of Yasui, the first case challenging the curfew to make it to court. The trial was held at the Federal Courthouse in Portland. Fee determined in his ruling issued on November 16, 1942, that the curfew could only apply to aliens, as martial law had not been imposed by the government. However, he also ruled that because Yasui had worked for the Japanese government he had forfeited his citizenship, so that the curfew did apply to him. Fee sentenced Yasui to one year in jail, which was served at the Multnomah County Jail, and $5,000 fine.Yasui v. U.S., 1943 WL 54783, Supreme Court of the United States. Appellate Brief, April 30, 1943. This federal court decision with constitutional and war power issues made news around the country.
Yasui then appealed his conviction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. After arguments in the case were filed, the court certified two question to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court then ordered the entire case be decided by that court, removing the case from further consideration by the Ninth Circuit.

The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case on May 10 and May 11, 1943, with Charles Fahy arguing the case for the United States as Solicitor General . Min’s defense team included E. F. Bernard from Portland and A. L. Wirin from Los Angeles. On June 21, 1943, the court issued its decision in the case along with the Hirabayashi v. United States case.
Citing Hirabayashi, Chief Justice Stone wrote the opinion of the court, and determined that the curfew and exclusion orders were valid, even as applied to citizens of the United States. Stone’s opinion was three pages and did not contain any concurring opinions or dissents, while the Hirabayashi decision had thirty-four pages and two concurring opinions. In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re-sentencing since the lower court had determined that the curfew was not valid, and that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship. The Supreme Court remanded (returned) the case back to the district court to determine a sentence in light of these circumstances.United States v. Minoru Yasui , 51 F. Supp. 234, D. Ore (1943)
Aftermath
Once the case returned to Judge Fee, he revised his earlier opinion to strike out the ruling that Yasui was no longer a United States citizen. Fee also removed the fine and reduced the sentence to 15 days, with the time already served.Yasui v. United States, 772 F.2d 1496  (C.A. 9) Yasui was released and moved into the Japanese internment camps.
Korematsu v. United States was decided the next year and overshadowed both the Yasui and Hirabayashi cases. The decisions were questioned by legal scholars even before the war had ended. Criticism has included the racist aspects of the cases and the later discovery that officials in the United States Department of Justice lied to the court at the time of the trial.
On February 1, 1983, Yasui petitioned the Oregon federal district court for a writ of error coram nobis due to the discovery of the falsehoods promulgated by the Department of Justice. This writ is only available to people who have already completed their imprisonment, and can only be used to challenge factual errors from the case. Yasui claimed in his writ that the government withheld evidence at the original trial concerning the threat of a Japanese attack on the United States mainland. The court dismissed the original indictment and conviction against Yasui, as well as the petition for the writ on request by the government. Yasui, then appealed the decision to dismiss the petition, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal on procedural grounds. However, the Ninth Circuit ultimately did vacate Hirabayashi's conviction, thereby impliedly vindicating Yasui as well. In 2011, the U.S. Solicitor General's office publicly confessed the Justice Department's 1943 ethical lapse in the Supreme Court. Minoru Yasui died on November 12, 1986.
Lawyers who represented Fred Korematsu, Gordon Hirabayashi, and Minoru Yasui in successful efforts in lower federal courts to nullify their convictions for violating military curfew and exclusion orders sent a letter dated January 13, 2014 to Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. In light of the appeal proceedings before the U.S. Supreme in Hedges v. Obama, the lawyers asked Verrili to request the Supreme Court overrule its decisions in Korematsu (1943), Hirabayashi (1943) and Yasui (1943). If the Solicitor General should not make the request, the lawyers asked that the federal government to make clear the federal government "does not consider the internment decisions as valid precedent for governmental or military detention of individuals or groups without due process of law [...]."

From "Yates v. United States" ==> """
Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298 (1957), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. that held that the First Amendment protected radical and reactionary speech, unless it posed a "clear and present danger."
Background
Fourteen lower echelon officials of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) were charged with violating the Smith Act by being members of the CPUSA in California. The Smith Act made it unlawful to advocate or organize the destruction or overthrow of any government in the United States by force. The appellants claimed that the Communist Party was engaged in passive political activities and that any violation of the Smith Act must involve active attempts to overthrow the government.
Opinion
To a large extent, the holding of the Yates case after the Dennis case reflects the judicial philosophy of Chief Justice Warren who advocates for greater freedom of speech in comparison to Fred M. Vinson.
The Supreme Court of the United States ruled 6–1 to overturn the convictions. It construed the Smith Act narrowly, stating that the term "organize" meant to form an organization, not to take action on behalf of an organization. The Court drew a distinction between actual advocacy to action and mere belief. The Court ruled that the Smith Act did not prohibit "advocacy of forcible overthrow of the government as an abstract doctrine." The Court recognized that "advocacy to action" circumstances would be "few and far between."Yates, 354 U.S. at 327.
Writing for the majority, Justice John Marshall Harlan introduced the notion of balancing society's right of self-preservation against the right to free speech.David M. O'Brien, Congress Shall Make No Law: the First Amendment, Unprotected Expression, and the Supreme Court (Rowman & Littlefield, 2010), 7–8 He wrote:

With respect to evidence required to convict in the absence of an appropriate standard, Black wrote:
Yates did not rule the Smith Act unconstitutional, but limited its application to such a degree that it became nearly unenforceable.John J. Patrick and Richard M. Pious, The Oxford Guide to the United States Government (Oxford University Press, 2001), 722–723 The Yates decision outraged some conservative members of Congress, who introduced legislation to limit judicial review of certain sentences related to sedition and treason, which did not pass.Micheal Belknap, "Communism and Cold War", in Patrick and Pious, Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court, 199
The appellants' convictions were reversed and the case was remanded to District Court for a retrial.
Reaction
The decision was announced on the same day as several other decisions in which communists were on the winning side, including Watkins v. United States and Sweezy v. New Hampshire (with the same majority and dissent). The day was called "Red Monday" by some anti-communists who disagreed with the decision.Sabin, Arthur J., In Calmer Times: the Supreme Court and Red Monday, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999, pp 138–142, . FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover called the decisions "the greatest victory the Communist Party in America ever received." President Eisenhower evaded questions about the decisions at a press conference, but wrote a letter to the Chief Justice after reports that he was "mad as hell" about them. The day was viewed as an indication of the Court's assertiveness under its new Chief Justice, with Time magazine headlining its coverage "U.S. Supreme Court: New Direction". Journalist I. F. Stone said the day "will go down in the history books as the day on which the Supreme Court irreparably crippled the witch hunt."Samuel Walker, Presidents and Civil Liberties from Wilson to Obama: A Story of Poor Custodians (Cambridge University Press, 2012), 196-7

From "Yates v. United States (2015)" ==> """
Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528 (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court construed 18 U.S.C. § 1519, a provision added to the federal criminal code by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to criminalize the destruction or concealment of "any record, document, or tangible object" to obstruct a federal investigation.. By a 5-to-4 vote, the Court stated that the term "tangible object" as used in this section means an object used to record or preserve information, and that this did not include fish.Yates v. United States, .
 Background 
Petitioner John L. Yates, a commercial fisherman, was operating in the Gulf of Mexico when a federal agent conducted an offshore inspection and found that the ship's catch had undersized red grouper, in violation of United States federal conservation regulations. The federal agent instructed Captain Yates to keep the undersized fish segregated; Yates instructed his crew to throw the undersized fish overboard, resulting in Yates being charged under 18 United States Code §1519. This provision, originating from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, states that a person may be fined or imprisoned for up to 20 years if the person "knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence" a federal investigation.
At trial, Yates sought an acquittal for the §1519 charge arguing that fish were not tangible objects related to record-keeping. The District Court denied the acquittal motion. Yates was found guilty by a jury of violating §1519 and sentenced to 30 days' imprisonment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the conviction, holding that fish have a physical form and are therefore a tangible object under a dictionary definition.
 Opinion of the Court 
Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg authored the plurality opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, holding that "within §1519's compass," a tangible object is "one used to record or preserve information." Among other things, the plurality relied upon traditional canons of statutory construction including the canons noscitur a sociis ("a word is known by the company it keeps") and ejusdem generis ("general words following a list of specific words should usually be read in light of those specific words"), as well as the section's enactment as part of a statute dealing with financial fraud and its location within title 18.
Associate Justice Samuel Alito filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment.
 Dissent 
Associate Justice Elena Kagan, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas, dissented. Justice Kagan concluded that a tangible object is "any object capable of being touched." Citing the United States Code and other U.S. laws, Kagan argued that tangible object "invariably covers physical objects of all
kinds" and that the surrounding language of §1519 makes it clear that Congress "meant the term to have a wide range."
The dissenting opinion suggests that the plurality opinion acknowledges that a tangible object is "a discrete thing that possesses physical form." Kagan continues this line of argument by holding that a fish "is, of course, a discrete thing that possesses physical form," citing Dr. Seuss's book One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (1960) as general evidence. Kagan's view is that under the "ordinary meaning of the term," a tangible object in §1519 covers fish (including undersized red grouper).

From "Ybarra v. Illinois" ==> """
Ybarra v. Illinois was a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court which ruled that a warrant can not be used to search an unnamed individual unless the warrant mentions that unnamed parties are involved or exigent circumstances are shown to exist.
Background
On March 1, 1976, an agent of the Illinois Bureau of Investigation, working in Aurora, requested a search warrant to search the Aurora Tap Tavern and its bartender for evidence of heroin trafficking, after an informant, "on the weekend" of February 28-29, observed 15 to 25 packets of tinfoil on the person of a bartender only known as "Greg," along with seeing the packets on him and in a drawer behind the bar when he went there on at least 10 other  occasions. The informant then claimed that he had used heroin in the past  and that foil was a common packaging method for heroin. The informant also claimed that from February 28 to February 29, he had a conversation with the bartender and that the bartender told him that he would have heroin for sale on March 1. The Aurora Police Department had previous dealings with this informant, whom they considered to be reliable. The judge signed the search warrant, authorizing "the following person or place: . . . [T]he Aurora Tap Tavern. . . . Also the person of 'Greg,' the bartender, a male white with blondish hair appx. 25 years." The warrant authorized the police to search for "evidence of the offense of possession of a controlled substance," to wit, "[h]eroin, contraband, other controlled substances, money, instrumentalities and narcotics, paraphernalia used in the manufacture, processing and distribution of controlled substances."
In the late afternoon of that day, 7-8 officers proceeded to the tavern. Upon entering the property, the officers announced to all present that they were going to conduct a "cursory search for weapons." One of the officers, Jerome Johnson, conducted a pat-down on all of the 13 customers while the rest of the force focused on extensively searching the property. Later, Johnson came to Ventura Ybarra, the latter standing by a pinball machine. During the first pat-down, the officer felt an object that was described as "a cigarette pack with objects in it." Johnson did not bother to remove it, instead moving on to other patrons. Eventually, Johnson  came back to Ybarra and searched him a second time. This time, he removed the cigarette packet from Ybarra's pants' pocket. When Johnson opened the package, he found six packets of foil containing a brown powder that was later identified as heroin. Full Ybarra v. Illinois text 
Trial and Appeals
At the arraignment, Ybarra was indicted by a grand jury on the charge of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. Ybarra then filed a motion to suppress against the packets of heroin seized from his person. During the hearing on the motion, the prosecution argued that the search was justified by Section 108-9 of the  Illinois Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1975, ch. 38, par. 108-9), which reads, "In the execution of the warrant the person executing the same may reasonably detain the search any person in the place at the time: (a) To protect himself from attack, or (b) To prevent the disposal or concealment of any instruments, articles or things particularly described in the warrant." 
The  trial court denied the motion, and Ybarra was convicted of heroin possession in a bench trial. He appealed to the Illinois Appellate Court-Second District, which upheld the conviction. Full People v.Ybarra text 
Opinion of the Court
In a 6-3 majority opinion, the Supreme Court ruled that the search of Ybarra was unconstitutional against the Fourth Amendment, along with the Fourteenth Amendment, therefore, his conviction should be overturned. Justice Potter Stewart authored the opinion, arguing that Terry v. Ohio does not apply in the circumstances surrounding the case because the search warrant was only for the tavern property and the bartender, not their customers. This meant that there was no probable cause to justify the search and arrest of Ybarra.
Burger's dissent
Justice Warren E. Burger filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices William Rehnquist and Harry A. Blackmun, arguing that the Court has violated the rationale of Terry by limiting the scope of  to "a particularized and individualized suspicion" that a person is armed and dangerous and that although, the warrant   narrowed the search to the bartender, the search  was valid because the tavern's patrons had a reputation for involvement in the narcotics trade, which made the possibility that they are armed reasonable. Furthermore, he stated that the officer's conduct was by-the-books, by not seizing the cigarette package first and making sure that none of the patrons  were armed, and going back to Ybarra and confiscating the package. Finally, he argued that the Court was slowing the police down from suppressing the flow of narcotics into their communities. 
Rehnquist's dissent
Justice William Rehnquist wrote his dissent, stating that the Court's reasoning was faulty, and claimed that since one or more of the tavern's customers could potentially be involved in the narcotics trade, the situation can escalate to dangerous levels due to the possibility of firearms. This, he reasoned, justified the search. Furthermore, he argued that Johnson's testimony during the pre-trial hearing that he had "felt objects" in the cigarette box created reasonable suspicion that heroin was in the container, which, he claimed, was within the boundaries of Terry v. Ohio. Finally, he ended by exclaiming that the search, in this case, was incidental, thus not being subject to the warrant requirement and that the search warrant was authorized by a neutral and detached magistrate, and that the officers conducted their duty pursuant to the warrant in an appropriate fashion.

From "Yellen v. Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation" ==> """
Yellen v. Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation, 594 U.S. ___ (2021), was a United States Supreme Court case dealing with the classification of Alaska Native corporations (ANCs) for purposes of receiving funds set-aside for tribal governments under the CARES Act. In a 6–3 decision issued in June 2021, the Court ruled that ANCs were considered to be "Indian tribes" and were eligible to receive the set-aside funds.
Background
Twelve Alaska Native corporations (ANCs) were established in the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act as for-profit corporations to operate businesses and services, often in the areas of oil and gas industry, to generate revenue that provides benefits to the Alaska Natives in the territories that they serve. This arrangement is unique to Alaska compared to native American tribes in the lower 48 states, where they operate their own tribal governments in recognized Indian reservations within federal law. Later, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDA) assured that both native American tribal governments and ANCs were given the self-autonomy to operate as governments for their respective peoples.
With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES Act in March 2020. The bill provided  in relief funding to businesses, of which  was earmarked for "tribal governments". The Treasury Department, in interpreting the law, opted to set aside about  of the  earmarked for ANCs.
The Treasury's decision was challenged separately by three Native tribes: the Navajo Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. They asserted that the ANCs were not officially recognized as tribal governments under the language of ISDA, and thus were ineligible to receive any of the CARES funds. The Native tribes expressed concern that the amount of funds available to them would be diluted if the ANC set-aside were allowed to stand. The three suits were consolidated at the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The district court ruled in favor of the Treasury Department, in that the ANCs could be considered tribal governments and eligible to receive CARES Act funds. The tribes appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which reversed the District Court's ruling. The Circuit Court ruled that as no ANC is federally recognized, compared to the tribal governments, they fail to qualify for the CARES Act funding.
Supreme Court
The Treasury Department under Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, with the backing of the Trump administration, petitioned to the Supreme Court, as the D.C. District Court had created a circuit split with a prior case, Cook Inlet Native Assn. v. Bowen (1987) from the Ninth Circuit on the classification of ANCs. Several of the ANCs also filed a similar petition. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to both petitions in January 2021, consolidating both under Yellen. The new administration under Joe Biden continued to back the position that ANCs were recognized tribal governments prior to the oral hearings.
Oral hearings were held on April 19, 2021. Observers states that the Justices sided with the position of the government, that ANCs were recognized tribal governments and thus eligible for funding. Justice Brett Kavanaugh said during the debate that ""tens of thousands of Native Alaskans would be left out completely" if they ruled differently. There was agreement that the language of ISDA was not clear how ANCs were to be classified, and would become a matter of statutory interpretation of the ISDA.
The Court issued its opinion on June 25, 2021. The 6–3 decision reversed the D.C. Circuit and remanded the case for review, ruling that ANCs, under the ISDA, do qualify as federally-recognized tribal governments, and thus are eligible to receive CARES funds. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion which was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito (in parts), Stephen Breyer, Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Sotomayor wrote "The Court today affirms what the Federal Government has maintained for almost half a century: ANCs are Indian tribes."
Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote a dissent, which was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Elena Kagan. Gorsuch wrote that by a statutory interpretation of ISDA, ANCs "are not 'recognized' as tribes eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians."

From "Yick Wo v. Hopkins" ==> """
Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), was the first case where the United States Supreme Court  ruled that a law that is race-neutral on its face, but is administered in a prejudicial manner, is an infringement of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.. 
Background
The immigration of Chinese to California began in 1850 at the beginning of the Gold Rush.  They soon began to branch out to jobs in agriculture and made up a large group of railroad workers.  As the Chinese became more successful, tensions with white Americans grew.  White Californians were wary of the cultural and ethnic differences.Chinese Immigration and the Chinese Exclusion Acts. US Department of State, 2010.  The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first of many pieces of legislation put into place to keep people from China from entering the United States.Chinese Exclusion Act (1882).  Harvard University Library. The government of California endeavored to prevent Chinese immigrants from working by requiring certain permits that they could not obtain, and passed legislation to prevent naturalization.   Many turned to the laundry business, and in San Francisco about 89% of the laundry workers were of Chinese descent. It was often the only job they could find.
In 1880, the elected officials of the city of San Francisco passed an ordinance making it illegal to operate a laundry in a wooden building without a permit from the Board of Supervisors.  The ordinance conferred upon the Board of Supervisors the discretion to grant or withhold the permits. At the time, about 95% of the city's 320 laundries were operated in wooden buildings. Approximately two-thirds of those laundries were owned by Chinese people.  Although most of the city's wooden building laundry owners applied for a permit, only one permit was granted of the two hundred applications from any Chinese owner, while only one out of approximately eighty non-Chinese applicants were denied a permit.
Yick Wo (), was a laundry facility owned by Lee Yick. Lee Yick immigrated to California in 1861.  After 22 years of managing the facility, provisions set out by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors said that he could not continue to run it in a wooden building.  He continued to operate his laundry and was convicted and fined ten dollars for violating the ordinance.  He sued for a writ of habeas corpus after he was imprisoned in default for having refused to pay the fine.
San Francisco ordinance
Order No. 156, passed May 26, 1880
Issue before the Court
The state argued that the ordinance was strictly one out of concern for safety, as laundries of the day often needed very hot stoves to boil water for laundry, and indeed laundry fires were not unknown and often resulted in the destruction of adjoining buildings as well.  The petitioner pointed out that prior to the new ordinance, the inspection and approval of laundries in wooden buildings had been left up to fire wardens.  Yick Wo's laundry had never failed an inspection for fire safety.  Moreover, the application of the prior law focused only on laundries in crowded areas of the city, while the new law was being enforced on isolated wooden buildings as well.  The law also ignored other wooden buildings where fires were common—even cooking stoves posed the same risk as those used for laundries.
Opinion of the Court
The Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Matthews, found that the administration of the statute in question was discriminatory and that there was therefore no need to even consider whether the ordinance itself was lawful. Even though the Chinese laundry owners were usually not American citizens, the court ruled they were still entitled to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Matthews also noted that the court had previously ruled that it was acceptable to hold administrators of the law liable when they abused their authority. He denounced the law as an attempt to exclude Chinese from the laundry trade in San Francisco, and the court struck down the law, ordering dismissal of all charges against other laundry owners who had been jailed.
The Court held that while the law wasn't discriminatory, it had been applied with "an evil eye and an unequal hand" in singling out Chinese laundry business owner Lee Yick.
Legacy
Yick Wo had little application shortly after the decision. In fact, it was not long after that the Court developed the "separate but equal" doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson,. in practice allowing discriminatory treatment of African Americans. Yick Wo was never applied at the time to Jim Crow laws. However, by the 1950s, the Warren Court used the principle established in Yick Wo to strike down several attempts by states and municipalities in the Deep South to limit the political rights of blacks. Yick Wo has been cited in well over 150 Supreme Court cases since it was decided.
Yick Wo is cited in Hirabayashi v. United States. to recognize that: "Distinctions between citizens solely based because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality. For that reason, legislative classification or discrimination based on race alone has often been held to be a denial of equal protection." However, the US Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Gordon Hirabayashi, the Japanese American who tested the curfew law and refused to register for the forced internment of people of Japanese descent during World War II.
In San Francisco there is a public school named Yick Wo Alternative Elementary School in honor of Yick Wo.

Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976), is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States upheld a city ordinance of Detroit, Michigan requiring dispersal of adult businesses throughout the city.
Justice Stevens (writing for the plurality) reasoned that the speech involved here is of lower value, and the city also has a compelling interest in protecting quality of life.
Justice Powell (concurring) disagreed with Stevens' "lower value speech" argument (thus limiting Part III of the opinion to a plurality), but wrote that this is only a place restriction with a limited effect on speech.

From "Young v. United Parcel Service" ==> """
Young v. United Parcel Service, 575 U.S. 206 (2015), is a United States Supreme Court case that the Court evaluated the requirements for bringing a disparate treatment claim under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.. In a 6–3 decision, the Court held that to bring such a claim, a pregnant employee must show that their employer refused to provide accommodations and that the employer later provided accommodations to other employees with similar restrictions. The Court then remanded the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to determine whether the employer engaged in discrimination under this new test.
 Background 
Pregnancy Discrimination Act
In 1978, the United States Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, amending Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to "prohibit sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy," as a direct response to the Court's ruling in General Electric Company v. Gilbert. The Act mandates that employers must treat “women affected by pregnancy . . . the same for all employment-related purposes . . . as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.”. However, the Act provides exceptions for a "legitimate, nondiscriminatory, nonpretextual justification for these differences in treatment.".
Initial lawsuit
In 2006, Peggy Young was working as a delivery driver for United Parcel Service when she requested time off in order to undergo in vitro fertilization. After becoming pregnant, Young's doctors advised her that "she should not lift more than 20 pounds during the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy or more than 10 pounds thereafter." United Parcel Service (UPS) requires that delivery drivers be able to lift parcels up to 70 pounds (150 pounds with assistance). Young informed UPS that she could not work while under a lifting restriction and stayed home without pay during most of the time she was pregnant. Because of her time away from work, Young lost her employee medical coverage. She then filed suit in federal court, claiming that "UPS acted unlawfully in refusing to accommodate her pregnancy-related lifting restriction."
 Decision 
Justice Stephen Breyer's majority opinion stated that the key inquiry was "whether the nature of the employer’s policy and the way in which it burdens pregnant women shows that the employer has engaged in intentional discrimination." He provided a balancing test for determining whether employers engaged in intentional discrimination under the terms of the Act. The test provided, "A worker making a claim that her company intentionally treated her differently due to her pregnancy must show that she sought an accommodation, her company refused and then granted accommodations to others suffering from similar restrictions. The company, in turn, can try to show that its reasons were legitimate — but not because it is more expensive or less convenient to add pregnant women to the categories of workers who are accommodated." To determine whether UPS engaged in discrimination under the terms of the new test, the Court remanded the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for further proceedings.
In a concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito stated that the wording of one of the clauses of the Act "adds a further requirement of equal treatment irrespective of intent." Therefore, he argued that pregnant employees must also be compared with other employees performing similar jobs with similar abilities.
In dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the primary intent of the Act was to clarify that pregnancy discrimination falls under the general definition of sex discrimination and that the majority opinion is instead basically crafting a new law.
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a separate dissent, stating that the majority interpreted the Act in a way that conflates "disparate impact" with "disparate treatment" and would result in confusion in litigating pregnancy discrimination cases.

From "Youngberg v. Romeo" ==> """
Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case regarding the rights of the involuntarily committed and those with intellectual disabilities. Nicholas Romeo had an intellectual disability with an infant level IQ and was committed to a Pennsylvania state hospital.  He was restrained for many hours of the day and repeatedly injured.Oyez: Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), U.S. Supreme Court Case Summary & Oral Argument The Supreme Court agreed with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals that involuntarily committed residents had the right to reasonably safe confinement conditions, no unreasonable body restraints and the habilitation they reasonably require.
Background
The defendants, who were management personnel at Pennhurst State School, an old state facility to which Romeo's mother had him committed when she could no longer care for him, did not dispute Romeo's right to care, habilitation, training and security.  The critical issue in the case was the standard of care and whether the defendants had violated that standard, and therefore, Romeo's federally protected civil rights.  The federal courts had not yet addressed this question in the context of intellectual disability.  The trial court therefore looked to a then-recent Supreme Court decision holding that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes "unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain" in violation of the 8th Amendment.  The jury found for the defendants.  The 3rd Circuit reversed and ordered a new trial, explaining that the standard of care should have been based on the 14th rather than the 8th Amendment and the Supreme Court agreed.  However, the high court rejected the circuit court's articulation of the standard of care.
Opinion of the Court
The syllabus summarizes the court's holding:
Respondent [Romeo] has constitutionally protected liberty interests under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to reasonably safe conditions of confinement, freedom from unreasonable bodily restraints, and such minimally adequate training as reasonably may be required by these interests.  Whether [his] constitutional rights have been violated must be determined by balancing these liberty interests against the relevant state interests.  The proper standard for determining whether the State has adequately protected such rights is whether professional judgment, in fact, was exercised.  And in determining what is 'reasonable,' courts must show deference to the judgment exercised by a qualified professional, whose decision is presumptively valid.
Subsequent developments
Shortly after it was remanded to the trial court the case was settled in conjunction with a state decision to close Pennhurst in 1986, and close all other such institutions.

From "Younger v. Harris" ==> """
Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that United States federal courts were required to abstain from hearing any civil rights tort claims brought by a person who is currently being prosecuted for a matter arising from that claim..
Facts
In 1966, several months after the Watts riots and in response to the killing of Leonard Deadwiler (a Black man shot by police while driving his pregnant wife to the hospital), John Harris, Jr., was arrested while handing out leaflets which said, among other things, "Wanted for the murder of Leonard Deadwiler, Bobo the cop."   
Harris, a member of the Progressive Labor Party, was indicted on two violations of the California Criminal Syndicalism Act, §§11400 and 11401. These statutes prohibited advocating "unlawful acts of force or violence [to] effect political change." Harris faced 14 years on each count. 
While prosecution was pending, Harris sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to get an injunction preventing District Attorney Evelle J. Younger from enforcing the law on the grounds that it violated the free speech guarantee. He was joined in this action by Jim Dan and Diane Hirsch, members of the PLP, and Farrel Broslawsky, a history instructor. In Harris v. Younger, 281 F. Supp. 507 (C.D. Cal. 1968), the district court found the Act unconstitutional, enjoining the state from further prosecution of Harris. Younger appealed.  
Decision and precedent
In an 8–1 decision, the Court held that federal courts may not hear the case until the person is convicted or found not guilty of the crime unless the defendant will suffer an irreparable injury that is "both great and immediate." Merely having to endure a criminal prosecution is no such irreparable harm.
There are three exceptions to Younger abstention:
Where the prosecution is in bad faith (i.e. the state knows the person to be innocent)—as applied in Dombrowski v. Pfister; or 
Where the prosecution is part of some pattern of harassment against an individual; or
Where the law being enforced is utterly and irredeemably unconstitutional (e.g., if the state were to pass a law making it a crime to say anything negative about its governor under any circumstances).
Dissent
In dissent, Justice Douglas noted, If the ‘advocacy’ which Harris used was an attempt at persuasion through the use of bullets, bombs, and arson, we would have a different case. But Harris is charged only with distributing leaflets advocating political action toward his objective...
The eternal temptation, of course, has been to arrest the speaker rather than to correct the conditions about which he complains. I see no reason why these appellees should be made to walk the treacherous ground of these statutes. They, like other citizens, need the umbrella of the First Amendment as they study, analyze, discuss, and debate the troubles of these days. When criminal prosecutions can be leveled against them because they express unpopular views, the society of the dialogue is in danger.
Status as precedent
The doctrine was later extended to situations where the state is seeking to execute a civil fine against someone, or has jailed a person for contempt of court. The doctrine applies even where the state does not bring an action until after the person has filed a lawsuit in federal court, provided that the federal court has not yet taken any action on the suit. Moreover, the principle of abstention applies to some state administrative proceedings.
In regard to the exceptions which the Younger Court articulated, later decisions make it clear that these are highly difficult to meet. 
Bad faith prosecution: in no case since Younger was decided has the Supreme Court found there to exist bad faith prosecution sufficient to justify a federal court injunction against state court proceedings. The Court has specifically declined to find bad faith prosecution even in circumstances where repeated prosecutions had occurred. As commentator Erwin Chemerinsky states, the bad-faith prosecution exception seems narrowly limited to facts like those in Dombrowski.Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction (5th ed. 2007), Aspen Publishers, p.860   Other scholars have even asserted that the possible range of cases which would fit the Dombrowski model and allow an exception to the no-injunction rule is so limited as to be an "empty universe."Chemerinsky, p. 859-60
Patently unconstitutional law: in no case since Younger was decided has the Supreme court found there to exist a patently unconstitutional law sufficient to justify a federal court injunction against state court proceedings. The Court has specifically declined to find such patent unconstitutionality in at least one case (Trainor v. Hernandez) 431 US 434 (1977), oyez.org
Inadequate state forum: the Supreme Court has found the state forum in question to be inadequate on a small number of occasions.e.g. Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 (1975), oyez.org 
Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U.S. 564 (1973), oyez.org

From "Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer" ==> """
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), also commonly referred to as the Steel Seizure Case or the Youngstown Steel case, was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision that limited the power of the President of the United States to seize private property. The case served as a check on the most far-reaching claims of executive power at the time and signaled the Court's increased willingness to intervene in political questions.
In the midst of the Korean War, the United Steel Workers of America threatened a strike—for higher wages—against the major steel producers in the United States. As President Harry S. Truman believed that a strike of any length would cause severe dislocations for defense contractors, Truman seized control of steel production facilities, keeping the current operating management of the companies in place to run the plants under federal direction. Though the steelworkers supported the move, the steel companies launched a legal challenge to the seizure on the grounds that the president lacked the power to seize private property without express authorization from Congress.
In his majority opinion, Associate Justice Hugo Black held that the president lacked the power to seize the steel mills in the absence of statutory authority conferred on him by Congress. Five other justices agreed with the outcome of the case but wrote concurring opinions; some of these justices argued that the president might have the power to seize property absent legislative authorization in more extreme circumstances. Justice Robert H. Jackson's concurring opinion laid out a tripartite framework of presidential power that would prove influential among legal scholars and others charged with assessing executive power. In his dissent, Chief Justice Fred Vinson argued that the president's action was necessary to preserve the status quo so that Congress could act in the future. Truman was stunned by the decision, but he immediately restored control of the steel mills to their owners.
Background
The United States was involved in the Korean War in 1950, when President Truman chose not to impose price controls, as the federal government had done during World War II. Instead, the administration attempted to avoid inflationary pressures by the creation of a Wage Stabilization Board that sought to keep down the inflation of consumer prices and wages while it avoided labor disputes whenever possible. Those efforts failed, however, to avoid a threatened strike against all major steel producers by the United Steel Workers of America when the steel industry rejected the board's proposed wage increases unless they were allowed greater price increases than the government was prepared to approve.
The Truman administration believed a strike of any length would cause severe dislocations for defense contractors and the domestic economy as a whole. Unable to mediate the differences between the union and the industry, Truman decided to seize production facilities while he kept the current operating management of the companies in place to run the plants under federal direction.
Rather than seizing the plants, Truman might have invoked the national emergency provisions of the Taft–Hartley Act to prevent the union from striking. The administration rejected that option, however, both from a distaste for the Act, which had been passed over Truman's own veto five years earlier and because the administration saw the industry, rather than the union, as the cause of the crisis.
The administration also rejected use of the statutory procedure provided under Section 18 of the Selective Service Act, which might have permitted seizure of the industry's steel plants on the ground that compliance with the procedure was too time-consuming and that its outcome too uncertain. Truman chose not to go to Congress to obtain additional statutory authorization for a seizure of the steel industry for the same reasons. That left invocation of the President's inherent authority to act in response to a national emergency.
The steelworkers favored government seizure of the plants under any available theory to a Taft–Hartley injunction against it; Arthur Goldberg, General Counsel for the Steelworkers and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), argued that the President had the inherent power to seize the plants as well as the statutory authority under the Selective Service Act and the Defense Production Act.
The steel industry, on the other hand, appears to have been taken by surprise, as it had apparently assumed, until shortly before Truman made his April 8, 1952 announcement, that he would take the less risky step of seeking a national emergency injunction under the Taft–Hartley Act instead. However, the industry was, as events showed, ready to act once Truman had announced the seizure by a national television and radio broadcast.
Prior history
The steel companies reacted immediately by sending attorneys to the home of Judge Walter M. Bastian of the D.C. District Court within 30 minutes of the end of the President's speech to ask for the issuance of a temporary restraining order. Judge Bastian scheduled a hearing for 11:30 the next day to hear arguments on the motion.
Because hearings on emergency motions came before a randomly-chosen judge, the hearing the next day was before Judge Alexander Holtzoff, a Truman appointee. Judge Holtzoff denied the motion on the ground that the balance of equities favored the government.
The case was then assigned to Judge David Andrew Pine, who heard the steel companies' motions for a preliminary injunction. In its papers, the government stressed the ultimate constitutional issue of whether the President had the power to seize the mills. The steel companies appeared to be shying away from that issue by focusing on the equities and asking the Court merely to enjoin the federal government from entering a collective bargaining agreement with the Steelworkers.
However, Judge Pine indicated that he was interested in the fundamental issue of Presidential power. Even so, the steel companies' attorneys continued to steer the discussion back to the equities and the President's statutory power under the Taft–Hartley Act. After the attorney for one of the smaller producers, Armco Steel Corporation, finally challenged the government's right to seize its property without Congressional authorization, Judge Pine then asked the attorney for the government to respond.
The Assistant Attorney General may have done more harm to the government's case than the steel companies had. Asked by Judge Pine for the source of the President's authority, he offered, "Sections 1, 2 and 3 of Article II of the Constitution and whatever inherent, implied or residual powers may flow therefrom." When the Court asked if the government took the position that "when the sovereign people adopted the Constitution ... it limited the powers of the Congress and limited the powers of the judiciary, but it did not limit the powers of the Executive", he assured Judge Pine that to be the case. He was, however, unable to name any cases that had held that the President had that power.
His presentation committed the Truman administration to an absolutist version of presidential power that went beyond the administration's own position. Truman's supporters in Congress first distanced themselves from the argument and then spread the message that Truman disavowed it as well. Finally, Truman issued a statement responding to a constituent's letter in which he acknowledged in very general terms the limitations that the Constitution imposed on his power to respond in a national emergency.
Two days later, Judge Pine issued an injunction, barring the government from continuing to hold the steel plants that it had seized. The Steelworkers began their strike within minutes of the announcement of the injunction. The government promptly appealed.
It first, however, formally requested for Judge Pine to stay his order and permit the government to resume control of the plants, ending the strike by the Steelworkers, but Judge Pine declined to do so. The government then applied for a stay in the D.C. Circuit. The Court, sitting en banc, granted the government's request for a stay by a 5–4 vote on April 30 and denied a motion for reconsideration by the steel companies that sought to amend the stay order to bar the government from increasing wages by the same margin the next day. The stay granted by the Court of Appeals was conditioned, however, on the government's filing of a petition for certiorari by May 2, 1952, and lasted only until the Supreme Court acted on that petition.
The government filed its petition for certiorari on May 2, only to discover that the steel companies had already filed one of their own. The government renewed its request for a stay.
In the meantime, the White House convened a meeting between the Steelworkers and the major steel companies on May 3. The talks made rapid progress and might have produced an agreement, but the announcement that the Supreme Court had granted certiorari and issued a stay that allowed the government to maintain possession of the steel mills but, coupled with an order barring any increase in wages during the pendency of the appeal, had removed any incentive for the steel companies to reach agreement on a new contract with the union.
Proceedings
The Court set the matter for oral argument on May 12, 1952, less than ten days later. The government's brief opened with an attack on Judge Pine's application of equitable principles to the facts before him but devoted much of its 175 pages to the historical records of governmental seizure of private property in wartime from the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 to Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and seizure of telegraph and railroad lines to the government's seizure of industrial properties in the First and the Second World Wars.
The steel industry's brief focused instead on the lack of statutory authority for this seizure and emphasized Congress's decision, when it had enacted the Taft–Hartley Act, to give the President the power to seek an injunction against strikes that might affect the national economy instead. It denied that the President had any power to seize private property without express legislative authorization and noted that Truman himself had asked for such legislative authority when the United Mine Workers of America went out on strike in 1950.
The Court set aside five hours for oral argument and allowed the Steelworkers and the railroad unions to speak as amicus curiae. Before an overflow crowd, John W. Davis argued for the steel companies that the President had no powers to make laws or, more particularly, to seize property without Congressional authorization. He explained away his own actions when he had defended the government's seizure of property while he had been US Solicitor General in Woodrow Wilson's administration and urged the justices to look beyond the transitory labor dispute before them to the constitutional principles at stake, closing with Thomas Jefferson's words, slightly misquoted: "In questions of power let no more be said of confidence in man but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution". Justice Frankfurter was the only Justice to interrupt Davis, with only one question, during his argument.
Solicitor General Philip B. Perlman had a rockier argument, as the Justices pressed him with questions on many of the points he made. Justice Jackson took pains to distinguish the facts concerning the seizure of the North American Aviation Company in 1941, which he had overseen as Attorney General at the time. Justice Douglas commented that if Perlman were correct as to the scope of the President's powers, there was no need for Congress. When Perlman attempted to close on a rousing note, reminding the Justices that it was during wartime, Justices Jackson and Frankfurter immediately contradicted him by noting that Congress had not declared war.
Goldberg, speaking for the Steelworkers, addressed whether the Taft–Hartley Act would have allowed for injunctive relief in those circumstances. The attorneys for the railroad brotherhoods, which were parties to a similar action coming up for review, addressed the President's inherent powers. Davis then gave his rebuttal by using only a few minutes of the hour that he had reserved.
Even despite the Court's evident lack of sympathy for the broad claims of inherent power made by the government, Truman and many other observers expected the Court to uphold his authority to act in the absence of express statutory authorization. Many commentators predicted that the Court would avoid the constitutional question, but others stressed the background that all of the Justices had in the New Deal and Fair Deal, when the powers of the Presidency had expanded greatly, and the past support of Justices such as Black, Reed, Frankfurter, and Douglas for the expansive application of the President's war powers.
As it turns out, most of those predictions were wrong. While Justice Burton harbored fears at one point that he might be the only Justice to vote against the government's position, he was encouraged by his private conversations with other Justices. In the end, the Court voted 6–3 to affirm the District Court's injunction to bar the President from seizing the steel plants.
Majority opinion
Justice Black wrote for the majority opinion that was delivered exactly three weeks after the oral hearing on June 2. Black took, as he often did, an absolutist view by holding that the President had no power to act except in those cases that are expressly or implicitly authorized by the Constitution or an Act of Congress.  Black wrote that the President's role in law-making is solely to recommend or veto laws.  He cannot overtake Congress's role to create new laws.Urofsky, Melvin I., and Paul Finkelman, "Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952)." Documents of American Constitutional and Legal History, third ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 723–725.
Concurring opinions
William O. Douglas
Douglas took a similarly-absolutist approach to the President's assertion of inherent power to cope with a national emergency.
Felix Frankfurter
Frankfurter avoided the sweeping condemnation of the administration's claims that Black and Douglas had offered. While he would not rule out the possibility that the President might acquire the power to take certain actions by a long course of conduct that was unobjected to by Congress, he found the statutory history persuasive evidence that Congress had not acquiesced, much less authorized, seizure of private property in the absence of a formal declaration of war.
Robert Jackson
Jackson's opinion took a similarly flexible approach to the issue by eschewing any fixed boundaries between the powers of Congress and the President. He divided Presidential authority towards Congress into three categories (in descending order of legitimacy):
 Cases in which the President was acting with express or implied authority from Congress
 Cases in which Congress had thus far been silent, referred to as a "zone of twilight"
 Cases in which the President was defying congressional orders (the "third category")
Jackson's framework would influence future Supreme Court cases on the president's powers and the relation between Congress and the presidency. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett elaborated during her Supreme Court nomination hearings in October 2020 the core content of Justice Jackson's concurring opinion:
In his concurring opinion in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring), Justice Jackson laid out the “familiar tripartite scheme” that the Supreme Court has since called “the accepted framework for evaluating executive action”:
First, “[w]hen the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate.” Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring). Second, “[w]hen the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.” Id., at 637. In such a circumstance, Presidential authority can derive support from “congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence.” Ibid. Finally, “[w]hen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb,” and the Court can sustain his actions “only by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.” Id., at 637–638.
Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491, 524–25 (2008) (quoting Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 635-38).
Harold Hitz Burton
Burton likewise concluded that Congress, not the President, had the power to act in emergencies by having the exclusive power to pass legislation. He relied on the language and legislative history of the Taft–Hartley Act to find that Congress had not authorized seizure of plants involved in a labor dispute without express legislative authorization. He hedged, however, on whether the President might, in more extreme circumstances, have the authority to act.
Tom Campbell Clark
Justice Clark, who had been Truman's Attorney General for four years before Truman appointed him to the Court, rejected the absolute approach of Black and Douglas and concluded that the President had some inherent power to act in the case of grave and imperative national emergencies. Clark refused, however, to define the boundaries of that power; in his view, the fact that Congress had provided in the Taft–Hartley Act, the Selective Service Act, and the Defense Production Act for procedures that the executive could have used ended the discussion by barring the President from relying on any inherent powers that he might otherwise have to choose a solution that was other than the ones that Congress had allowed.
Dissenting opinion
Chief Justice Vinson dissented, joined by Justices Reed and Minton. His opinion dealt at some length with the history of presidential seizures. In the oral presentation of his opinion, he went out of his way to make a sarcastic reference to the contrary positions that Jackson and Clark had taken when they were the Attorneys General for Franklin Roosevelt and Truman, respectively. Rejecting the view that Congress had limited the executive's authority to seize property in this case by providing for different procedures in the legislation it had enacted, Vinson's opinion still appeared to recognize Congress's primacy in enacting legislation by justifying the seizure in this case as necessary to preserve the status quo so that Congress could act in the future. However, he mocked arguments based on the Constitution's provision that allowed the President to recommend legislation, rather than make it himself, as "the messenger-boy concept of the Office".
Aftermath
right|upright=0.8|thumb|President Harry Truman
Within minutes of the Court's ruling, Truman ordered Commerce Secretary Charles Sawyer to return the steel mills to their owners; he did so immediately. The Steelworkers went out on strike again shortly thereafter. The strike lasted for more than 50 days until the President threatened to use the somewhat-cumbersome procedures under the Selective Service Act to seize the mills.
Truman was stunned by the decision, which he continued to attack years later in his Memoirs. Justice Black was concerned enough that Truman would take the decision personally that he invited Truman and his fellow Justices to a party at his home. Truman, still smarting from the defeat, was mollified somewhat by Black's hospitality; as he told Black, "Hugo, I don't much care for your law, but, by golly, this bourbon is good."
The multiplicity of opinions made it difficult to determine just what the Court had decided as to whether and when the President had authority to act without Congressional authorization. That was largely the result of the fact that the administration had made a weak case. The evidence of an actual emergency was tenuous because of the substantial stockpiles of steel products in many sectors of the economy, the administration's case was made even weaker by overstating its position and offering incoherent arguments in the early phases of the litigation, which turned public opinion against it, and framed the public debate in the most simplistic terms.
The decision still has had a broad impact by representing a check on the most extreme claims of executive power at the time and the Court's assertion of its own role in intervening in political questions. The Court later did so in Baker v. Carr and Powell v. McCormack and also applied the Frankfurter-Jackson approach to analyzing Congress' legislative authorization of Presidential action in invalidating efforts by the Nixon administration to plant wiretaps without prior judicial approval, and it cited the case more generally in support of its decision to permit litigation against the president to proceed in Clinton v. Jones. The Supreme Court also relied on Youngstown in Medellín v. Texas (2008), in which President George W. Bush had pressured the state of Texas to review the murder conviction of a Mexican citizen, who had tortured and raped two teenage girls in 1993, by arguing that a 2004 decision by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) required law enforcement authorities to tell the accused of his right under the Vienna Convention to notify Mexican diplomats of his detention. In a 6–3 decision, the Court held that ICJ rulings were not enforceable in the United States and that Bush's actions were unconstitutional. Quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Chief Justice John Roberts concluded, "The president's authority to act, as with the exercise of any governmental power, 'must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself'."Quoted in David Stout (March 25, 2008). "Justices Rule Against Bush on Death Penalty Case". The New York Times.
However, the Court drew back from some of the implications of its decision by refusing to rely on Youngstown as authority to review the failed challenges brought against the War in Vietnam and deferring to the executive branch's authority over foreign policy in cases such as Zemel v. Rusk. The Supreme Court also cited Youngstown in the 2006 decision Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.

From "Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas" ==> """
Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas, 596 U.S. ___ (2022), was a United States Supreme Court case dealing with whether the state of Texas could control and regulate gambling on Texan Native American reservations. In a 5–4 decision issued in June 2022, the Court ruled that the Restoration Act bans only gaming activities also banned by the state of Texas.
Background
During the period between 1968 and 1987, two of the three tribes of Texas- the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama-Coushatta- were held under a trust with the state of Texas. After this relationship was subsequently rendered invalid by the Texas State Constitution, the tribes were transferred under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Government via the Restoration Act. During this time frame, the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo instituted a process of recreational electronic bingo despite the fact that the state of Texas only permitted the game for matters of Charity. Thus, conflict arose between two provisions within the Restoration Act. The first which barred gambling activity "prohibited" by state law while the second as having the statute not be a "grant of civil or criminal regulatory jurisdiction to the State of Texas". As such, The conflict focused on whether the "prohibition" of Gambling laws extends towards the regulation of gaming or whether the term references only games band by the state. Initial holdings by the lower courts were largely sympathetic towards the State of Texas' reasoning, with the Fifth Circuit hearing the case after a state challenge against the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo for the use of Bingo games that failed to meet Texan regulatory laws.
Supreme Court
The Ysleta del Sur Pueblo appealed to the Supreme Court following tribal opposition to the 5th Circuits interpretation of the Act. Oral Arguments were held on February 22, 2022, with the decision being put forth and released on June 15, 2022. the 5–4 decision, written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, stipulated that the provision that bars gambling "prohibited" by the state only covers forms of gambling outright banned by the state. In doing so he noted the differences between the terms 'prohibition' and 'regulation' stating that "to prohibit something means to ‘forbid,’ prevent,’ or ‘effectively stop’ it, or ‘make [it] impossible.’" In contrast, [...] 'to regulate something is usually understood to mean to ‘fix the time, amount, degree, or rate’ of an activity ‘according to rule[s].’". In addition to this reasoning, Gorsuch turned towards precedent and 'contextual clues' like those of California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians where the state could regulate gambling it outright prohibited, but not those that it gives conditions for. The dissent, written by Chief Justice John Roberts opposed the viewpoint presented in the majority opinion, instead stipulating that a "straightforward reading" made it clear that all gambling prohibited by the state is also barred on tribal land. Outside reactions to the decision included that of Ricky Sylestine, chair of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas’ Tribal Council, who lauded the decision as "an affirmation of Tribal sovereignty and a victory for the Texas economy" though Gorsuch stipulated that  "None of this is to say that the Tribe may offer gaming on whatever terms it wishes [...] Other gaming activities are subject to tribal regulation and must conform to the terms and conditions set forth in federal law."

Redhail, 434 U.S. 374 (1978), was a U.S. Supreme Court decision that held that Wisconsin Statutes §§ 245.10 (1), (4), (5) (1973) violated the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause..   Section 245.10 required noncustodial parents who were Wisconsin residents attempting to marry inside or outside of Wisconsin to seek a court order prior to receiving a marriage license.  In order to receive such a court order, the noncustodial parent could not be in arrears on his or her child support, and the court had to believe that the child(ren) would not become dependent on the State.The text of the statute was:
245.10 Permission of court required for certain marriages
(1) No Wisconsin resident having minor issue not in his custody and which he is under obligation to support by any court order or judgment, may marry in this state or elsewhere, without the order of either the court of this state which granted such judgment or support order, or the court having divorce jurisdiction in the county of this state where such minor issue resides or where the marriage license application is made. No marriage license shall be issued to any such person except upon court order. The court, within 5 days after such permission is sought by verified petition in a special proceeding, shall direct a court hearing to be held in the matter to allow said person to submit proof of his compliance with such prior court obligation. No such order shall be granted, or hearing held, unless both parties to the intended marriage appear, and unless the person, agency, institution, welfare department or other entity having the legal or actual custody of such minor issue is given notice of such proceeding by personal service of a copy of the petition at least 5 days prior to the hearing, except that such appearance or notice may be waived by the court upon good cause shown, and, if the minor issue were of a prior marriage, unless a 5-day notice thereof is given to the family court commissioner of the county where such permission is sought, who shall attend such hearing, and to the family court commissioner of the court which granted such divorce judgment. If the divorce judgment was granted in a foreign court, service shall be made on the clerk of that court. Upon the hearing, if said person submits such proof and makes a showing that such children are not then and are not likely thereafter to become public charges, the court shall grant such order, a copy of which shall be filed in any prior proceeding under s. 52.37 or divorce action of such person in this state affected thereby; otherwise permission for a license shall be withheld until such proof is submitted and such showing is made, but any court order withholding such permission is an appealable order. Any hearing under this section may be waived by the court if the court is satisfied from an examination of the court records in the case and the family support records in the office of the clerk of court as well as from disclosure by said person of his financial resources that the latter has complied with prior court orders or judgments affecting his minor children, and also has shown that such children are not then and are not likely thereafter to become public charges. No county clerk in this state shall issue such license to any person required to comply with this section unless a certified copy of a court order permitting such marriage is filed with said county clerk.
(4) If a Wisconsin resident having such support obligations of a minor, as stated in sub. (1), wishes to marry in another state, he must, prior to such marriage, obtain permission of the court under sub. (1), except that in a hearing ordered or held by the court, the other party to the proposed marriage, if domiciled in another state, need not be present at the hearing. If such other party is not present at the hearing, the judge shall within 5 days send a copy of the order of permission to marry, stating the obligations of support, to such party not present.
(5) This section shall have extraterritorial effect outside the state; and s. 245.04(1) and (2) are applicable hereto. Any marriage contracted without compliance with this section, where such compliance is required, shall be void, whether entered into in this state or elsewhere.
History
In 1972, Roger Redhail, then in high school, was sued in a paternity action in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin.  He admitted he was the father, and the court ordered him to pay child support in the amount of $109 per month until the child reached eighteen years of age, plus court costs.  Since Redhail was in high school at the time, he had no way to pay the court costs or child support.  It went in arrears, reaching a total of $3,732 by the end of 1974.  Meanwhile, Redhail's noncustodial child was a public charge, and received $109 per month as support from the State of Wisconsin.
In 1974, Redhail attempted to obtain a marriage license in Milwaukee County.  Due to the aforementioned § 245.10(1), one of the agents of the county clerk denied his application because he did not have a court order allowing him to marry.  Redhail proceeded to file a class action suit against Thomas Zablocki, who was the county clerk of Milwaukee County (and whose official capacity was to issue such licenses) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and since the action sought a permanent injunction against the statute,  (since repealed) then required a three-judge District Court.Redhail, 418 F. Supp. at 1064.
Judge John Reynolds wrote for the three-judge court.  After disposing with issues regarding interactions with State court actions and class action procedure, he reached the substantive matter under which Redhail filed suit.  Finding that the Wisconsin statute created two separate classes of individuals, Reynolds then proceeded to observe that under a number of Supreme Court decisions,Reynolds mentions Roe v. Wade, Boddie v. Connecticut (1971), Loving v. Virginia, Griswold v. Connecticut, Skinner v. Oklahoma (1942), and Meyer v. Nebraska (1923), among other lower court decisions.  Redhail, 418 F. Supp. at 1069. marriage was held to be a fundamental right.  Accordingly, the judge applied strict scrutiny to determine whether the Wisconsin statute could survive constitutional review.
Examining the State's interest in the matter, Reynolds found that while Wisconsin surely had a legitimate interest in counseling, that interest was not perceived as a compelling interest.  While he found that the State's interest in child welfare was potentially compelling, that interest was insufficient because the Wisconsin statute was not connected to the restriction imposed by the statute.  As the Wisconsin law could not withstand strict scrutiny, Reynolds declared the law unconstitutional.
Supreme Court Review
When federal suits proceed in three-judge District Courts,  allows parties to appeal directly to the Supreme Court.See .  Accordingly, the Supreme Court noted probable jurisdiction, 429 U.S. 1089 (1977).  The case was argued early in the October term of 1977, and the judgment was issued in January 1978.
Majority Opinion
Justice Marshall wrote for the 5 justice majority court holding.  Affirming the judgment of the District Court, Marshall concurred with the District Court's reading of marriage being a fundamental right, relying on Loving v. Virginia (1967) and Griswold v. Connecticut (1965).  Marshall, however, diverged from the District Court's analysis by refusing to apply strict scrutiny.  Instead, he determined if Wisconsin's law was "supported by sufficiently important state interests and is closely tailored to effectuate only those interests".Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 388.  Marshall's standard is similar to strict scrutiny as his "closely tailored" is similar to the strict scrutiny standard of requiring a statute to be narrowly tailored to the interest,See, e.g.,  ("[R]egulation[s] limiting [fundamental] rights may be justified only by a 'compelling state interest,' and ... legislative enactments must be narrowly drawn to express only the legitimate state interests at stake.") (citations omitted). but it requires only an "important state interest", which is akin to intermediate scrutiny.See, e.g.,  ("the proper test is whether the State has ... show[n] that the ... classification is substantially related to an important governmental objective.") (confronting sex-based classifications).
Applying this standard, Marshall examined the same two justifications that the District Court confronted—child welfare and counseling noncustodial parents about their obligations.  These justifications are defeated because as Marshall explained, Wisconsin could find other ways to achieve the interest without resorting to infringement of a fundamental right, and that the latter reason is defective because it fails to achieve the objectives it sets out to meet (which is one of the necessities of being narrowly tailored).  Accordingly, Marshall affirmed the District Court by focusing the lack of connection and efficacy of the measures Wisconsin advances, rather than confronting the importance of Wisconsin's interests.
Concurring Opinions
Three of the Justices wrote concurring opinions.  Chief Justice Warren Burger was part of the majority opinion but wrote a separate one as well.  Justices Stewart and Powell each wrote their own concurrence agreeing with the judgment of the court.
Burger's Concurrence
Chief Justice Burger joined with Justice Marshall's opinion, and concurred separately to note that the Wisconsin statute was an "intentional and substantial interference with the right to marry", distinguishing this case from Califano v. Jobst (1977).Zablocki, 434 U.S., at 391 (Burger, C.J., concurring).
Stewart's Concurrence in the Judgment
Justice Stewart reaches a conclusion nearly identical to the Court's conclusion, but wholly rejects the Court's equal protection analysis, likening it to be the improper analysis for the denial of a right.  Stewart disagrees with the majority's contention that there is a fundamental right to marry, or even an explicit right to marry at all.  Rather, he grounds his analysis in the liberty interest of the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause.Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 391-392 (Stewart, J., concurring in the judgment).  Reasoning that lacking money is not an acceptable reason to restrict a person's liberty,  he concludes that the traditions of the United States forbid such a restriction, and that the proper justification for holding the law to be unconstitutional is substantive due process.Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 394-395 (Stewart, J., concurring in the judgment).  For the root of this kind of analysis, see Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937) (finding that protected practices are "principle[s] of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.").
Powell's Concurrence in the Judgment
Justice Powell concurs in the judgment in a similar manner to Justice Stewart.  Powell's primary concern is that the near-application of strict scrutiny and the use of the equal protection clause is too strong and interferes with the legitimate regulation of the State on marriage.For example, Powell is concerned that an inflexible application of the equal protection clause would prohibit the State from making laws on "incest, bigamy, and homosexuality", among other conditions.  Zablocki, 434 U.S., at 399 (Powell, J., concurring in the judgment).  Similar to Justice Stewart, Powell would use the due process clause, but invoke it in a way that would be flexible enough to allow the State to pass reasonable regulations (regulations that probably would not be upheld under Marshall's standard).
Stevens's Concurrence in the Judgment
Justice Stevens's concurrence in the judgment is different from the other two because he wishes to distinguish between different kinds of classifications.  Stevens states that "[a] classification based on marital status is fundamentally different from a classification which determines who may lawfully enter into the marriage relationship."Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 403-404 (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment).  In making this distinction, Stevens wishes to separate Zablocki and Loving from Califano v. Jobst.  The intent of his opinion is to illustrate that distinctions between married and unmarried people are largely acceptable, whereas bars to marriage itself should be treated with skepticism.  Further, he too concludes that the methods of Wisconsin's law fall far short of achieving its objectives (reasoning through multiple claims that Wisconsin's desired outcome does not comport with the reality of the situation).
Rehnquist's Dissent
Justice Rehnquist was the only justice to dissent completely from the ruling of the court.  Agreeing with Justice Powell, Rehnquist concludes that there is no fundamental right to marriage.  Further he would conclude that the appropriate measure for this case is the rational basis testZablocki, 434 U.S. at 407 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).—that the law need be only rationally related to a legitimate State interest.  Rehnquist contended that the appropriate frame of analysis for the Court should be one that is deferential to the concerns of the legislature.  The key to this viewpoint is the realization that Wisconsin "'adopted this rule in the course of constructing a complex social welfare system that necessarily deals with the intimacies of family life'"Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 408 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).—that Wisconsin made a "permissible exercise of [its] power" even though its results may not be as intended.
Rehnquist also disagreed that Redhail had standing to bring his claim.  Examining the record of the District Court and of oral arguments, he finds that it was never verified that Redhail could not pay for his child support obligations. With this argument, the Justice notes that Redhail may not be an acceptable member of his class and thus might not have been able to bring the challenge that he brought.  However Rehnquist notes that because he finds the law to be valid, there is no need to reach the question of standing.Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 409-410 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).
Subsequent implications
Zablocki has been cited as precedent and is now considered to be part of a constitutional fundamental right to marry, along with cases like Loving v. Virginia, Turner v. Safley, and Obergefell v. Hodges, the Court has declared a fundamental right to marriage under the Fourteenth Amendment.

From "Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co." ==> """
Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., 433 U.S. 562 (1977), was an important U.S. Supreme Court case concerning rights of publicity..  The Court held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not immunize the news media from civil liability when they broadcast a performer's entire act without his consent, and the Constitution does not prevent a state from requiring broadcasters to compensate performers.  It was the first time (and so far the only time) the Supreme Court heard a case on rights of publicity.
 Facts and procedural history 
Petitioner Hugo Zacchini had a human cannonball act which he performed at various venues.  During August 1972, he was performing his act at the Geauga County Fair in Burton, Ohio.  On August 30, Zacchini noticed a freelance reporter from Scripps-Howard Broadcasting (which operated WEWS-TV in Cleveland) who had brought a movie camera into the fair.  Zacchini asked the reporter not to film his act.  The reporter did not film Zacchini's act that day, but did film him the next day.  The footage taken by the reporter was about fifteen seconds long, sufficient to capture Zacchini's entire act.
Zacchini filed suit against Scripps-Howard in Ohio state court, alleging that the local reporter "showed and commercialized the film of his act without his consent," and that such conduct was an "unlawful appropriation of plaintiff's professional property."  The trial court granted the defendant summary judgment.  The Ohio Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Zacchini's complaint stated a cause of action for conversion and for infringement of a common law copyright, and that the press was not privileged to show Zacchini's entire act on television without compensating him.
The case was then heard by the Ohio Supreme Court, who reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals in favor of Scripps-Howard.  The Ohio Supreme Court held that although Scripps-Howard would be liable for appropriating Zacchini's name, likeness, and performance, 
A TV station has a privilege to report in its newscasts matters of legitimate public interest which would otherwise be protected by an individual's right of publicity, unless the actual intent of the TV station was to appropriate the benefit of the publicity for some nonprivileged private use, or unless the actual intent was to injure the individual.433 U.S. at 565 (internal quotation marks omitted)
The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments immunized respondent from damages for its alleged infringement of Zacchini's right of publicity under Ohio state law.
 Decision 
 Majority opinion 
Justice White wrote for the majority.  He held first that, because the Ohio Supreme Court based its decision on the scope of protection offered to the press by the Federal constitution (rather than the Ohio state constitution), no adequate and independent state ground existed for the Ohio Supreme Court's decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court therefore had jurisdiction.
Moving on to the substantive constitutional issue of the case, White disagreed with the Ohio Supreme Court that the press should be privileged in showing Zacchini's entire act.  He distinguished this case from Time, Inc. v. Hill, the U.S. Supreme Court case upon which the Ohio Supreme Court relied in their opinion.  Time, Inc. v. Hill was a case which dealt with the tort of "false light", i.e. portraying a person in a misleading or embarrassing manner, rather than the appropriation of a performer's act or likeness, which was at stake there.  White analogized Zacchini's interest in protecting his act from being shown without his permission to those interests protected by patent and copyright:  Zacchini not only had a commercial interest in being compensated for the time and effort involved in his performance, but also the "economic incentive for him to make the investment required to produce a performance of interest to the public".433 U.S. at 576  White concluded by saying that while a state government may pass a law shielding the press from liability for broadcasting performers' acts, the First and Fourteenth amendments do not require the states to do so.
 Dissenting opinions 
Justice Powell, joined by justices Brennan and Marshall, disagreed with the standard set forth by the majority.  Powell felt that the majority concentrated too heavily on the fact that the footage which was broadcast constituted Zacchini's "entire act" (which, Powell noted, was a rather uncertain standard in itself), rather than examining the purpose for which the footage was used.  Since the footage was used for the purpose of reporting news, rather than for commercial exploitation, Powell asserted that the television station's use of the footage should be considered privileged from liability.  He worried that the majority's holding may have a chilling effect on freedom of the press:
The Court's holding that the station's ordinary news report may give rise to substantial liability has disturbing implications, for the decision could lead to a degree of media self-censorship.  Hereafter, whenever a television news editor is unsure whether certain film footage received from a camera crew might be held to portray an "entire act," he may decline coverage – even of clearly newsworthy events – or confine the broadcast to watered-down verbal reporting, perhaps with an occasional still picture. The public is then the loser. This is hardly the kind of news reportage that the First Amendment is meant to foster.433 U.S. at 580–581 (Powell, J., dissenting) (internal citations omitted)
Justice Stevens wrote a separate dissent.  He felt that a better resolution of the case would have been to remand it back to the Ohio Supreme Court for clarification of the state law issue before attempting to resolve the constitutional issue.  Stevens felt that it was not clear whether the Ohio Supreme Court was basing its holding purely on the boundaries of common law torts or the First Amendment.

From "Zadvydas v. Davis" ==> """
Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. The court ruled that the plenary power doctrine does not authorize the indefinite detention of immigrants under order of deportation whom no other country will accept. To justify detention of immigrants for a period longer than six months, the government was required to show removal in the foreseeable future or special circumstances.
Background
Fifth Circuit case
Kestutis Zadvydas was a resident alien in the United States who was ordered deported in 1994 based on his criminal record. Zadvydas was born of Lithuanian parents while in Germany, but was not a citizen of either country, and neither would accept him..  Under federal law, once a person has been ordered to be deported, the U.S. Attorney General is required to detain them and complete the deportation within 90 days. However, the Attorney General claimed that if the 90-day period passed by without completing the desired deportation, the detention period could be continued indefinitely until the person could be deported.
In September 1995 after Lithuania and Germany had refused to accept Zadvydas, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in U.S. District Court. In 1996 the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) unsuccessfully requested that the Dominican Republic accept Zadvydas based on his wife's Dominican citizenship. In October 1997 the District Court granted the writ and ordered him released under supervision.  The government appealed and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the district court.
Ninth Circuit case
Kim Ho Ma was a Cambodian, also a resident alien in the United States.  At age 17, Kim was convicted of manslaughter and was ordered deported.  Cambodia did not have a treaty with the United States and would not accept Kim. In 1999, Kim filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in U.S. District Court. A five-judge panel of that court considered Kim's case in connection with about 100 other cases and ordered him released. The government appealed and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court.
Appeals
Zadvydas in the Fifth Circuit case and the government in the Kim case both appealed to the Supreme Court. As both circuit courts had come to opposing positions, there was a split in the circuits which may only be resolved by a Supreme Court ruling. The court granted certiorari in both cases and consolidated the cases for the hearing.
Opinions of the court
Arguments
Robert F. Barnard argued the case for Zadvydas. Jay W. Stansell argued the case for Kim.  Representing the United States was Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler. Amicus curiae briefs were filed by the Washington Legal Foundation on behalf of the government in the Zadvydas case and by the Legal Immigration Network, Inc., the American Association of Jews from the former USSR, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch, and Carolyn Patty Blum, et al., on behalf of Kim.
Majority opinion
thumb|left|150px|alt=photograph of Justice Stephen Breyer|Justice Stephen Breyer, author of the majority opinion
Justice Stephen Breyer delivered the opinion of the court. He noted that the statute grants the Attorney General the authority to detain a deportee past the term of the 90-day removal period, without judicial or administrative review. Breyer indicated that an indefinite, potentially permanent detention was unconstitutional. Using the principles of statutory construction, Breyer stated that the court must infer that the law limits such a detention to that period that is necessary to accomplish the removal of the alien from the United States. Since the detention was for the purpose of removing the alien from the country, once the alien cannot be removed, the immigration purpose for the detention no longer exists. Without a limitation on detentions, the court would be forced to declare the law unconstitutional. He noted that allowing an administrative agency to conduct an unreviewable hearing on such a fundamental right had already been ruled against by the court.
The government also argued that Congress had plenary power to enact such a law under its authority to control immigration, and that both the executive and judicial branches must defer to that decisionmaking.  Breyer noted that while Congress may use that power, they "must choose 'a constitutionally permissive means of implementing' that power" and the interpretation that the government advocates is not such a permissive means. The court ruled that a hearing must be held after a six-month detention. Substantive due process applied to aliens that resided within the United States, and absent a showing that they were a danger to society or a flight risk, they could not be detained.
Dissenting opinions
thumb|right|150px|alt=photograph of Justice Antonin Scalia|Justice Antonin Scalia, author of one of the dissenting opinionsJustice Antonin Scalia dissented from the majority.  Scalia stated that an alien who has no legal right to be in the United States has no right to release into the country that is trying to expel him or her. Scalia quoted Justice Robert H. Jackson in his dissent, in asserting that "Due process does not invest any alien with a right to enter the United States, nor confer on those admitted the right to remain against the national will." [italics in original]
Justice Anthony Kennedy also dissented. Kennedy said that the majority disregarded congressional intent and then rewrote the statute. He posited that Congress gave the Attorney General the express authority to order continued detention, and added that the majority misapplied the concept of statutory construction, noting that the court could only distinguish between plausible interpretations. If there were two or more interpretations, then the court is bound to accept the one that does not create a constitutional issue, but Kennedy states that this was never the situation in this case. 
Subsequent developments
Impact
According to the U.S. Inspector General, nearly 134,000 immigrants with final orders of removal were released into the general population in the U.S. from 2001 to 2004, as a result of the Zadvydas ruling.Congressional Testimony, May 24, 2011 (available here According to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, nearly 4000 immigrants with criminal records have been released into the general population in the U.S. each year since 2008.
According to a number of legal experts, INS has taken the view that it can detain aliens for preventive rather than punitive purposes. These experts state INS has no authority to conduct a punitive detention, which is only authorized by criminal statutes. Civil libertarians have noted that over 2,000 aliens have been held indefinitely without hope of repatriation and that the Department of Homeland Security holds approximately 31,000 immigrants in detention at any given time.
It has been noted that 20 years prior to the Zadvydas decision, approximately 122,000 Mariel Cubans had been paroled into the United States after facing indefinite detention. Most of these were inadmissible to the United States due to their criminal convictions in Cuba and in the U.S., but were not deportable as Cuba refused to accept them back. Once paroled, they remained ineligible for lawful permanent residency in the United States. In one case, a resident alien with a 20-year-old battery conviction was detained for more than four years before being released.
Opponents of the Zadvydas decision note that suspects in two murder cases in 2012 had been allowed to stay in the U.S. despite final deportation orders. In January 2012, the Miami Herald revealed that Kesler Dufrene, accused of murdering three people in Miami, was released from federal detention despite a final deportation order to Haiti because the U.S. suspended deportations to that country for several months after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. This case also allowed deportee Binh Thai Luc to be released from immigration detention after his native Vietnam declined to offer the U.S. government travel documents. Luc was arrested in March 2012 for the murder of five people in San Francisco.
Zadvydas was also cited by the 9th Circuit three-judge appeals panel on February 9, 2017, in Washington v. Trump, with regard to an executive order concerning the restriction of immigration from certain stipulated countries. In that case, the 9th Circuit panel referred to the Zadvydas opinion "emphasizing that the power of the political branches over immigration 'is subject to important constitutional limitations'."
Following the 2002 signing of a repatriation agreement between Cambodia and the United States, Kim Ho Ma was deported. As of 2007, he lived in a rural area of Cambodia with his wife.
 Supreme Court case 
Zadvydas was cited in a subsequent Supreme Court case, Clark v. Martinez,Clark v. Martinez, that reiterated the principle that all people within the United States were entitled to due process and could not be deprived of liberty indefinitely.  Justice Scalia, despite his dissent in Zadvydas, authored the 7–2 decision in Clark.  The government had argued that the law allowed the government to detain people up to the point that the detention "approached constitutional limits."  Scalia noted that "If we were, as the Government seems to believe, free to 'interpret' statutes as becoming inoperative when they 'approach constitutional limits,' we would be able to spare ourselves the necessity of ever finding a statute unconstitutional as applied."
 Legislative remedies 
In an effort to roll back Zadvydas, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) has introduced the "Keep Our Communities Safe Act" (H.R. 1932), legislation aimed at allowing indefinite detention of unremovable admitted immigrants and asylum applicants (immigrants awaiting approval of asylum applications).Keep Our Communities Safe Act, H.R. 1932, 112th Cong. (2011), http://judiciary.house.gov/news/pdfs/Keep%20Our%20Communities%20Safe.pdf. Three experts lent support to the legislation during a hearing on the Act: Gary Mead, Executive Associate Director for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations; Thomas H. Dupree, Jr., partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP (and former Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General under President Bush); and Ft. Myers Chief of Police Douglas Baker, a colleague of Officer Widman who was murdered by an alien released as a result of Zadvydas.Testimony is online at: Mead: http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Mead05242011.pdf; Dupree: http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Dupree05242011.pdf; Baker: http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Douglas05242011.pdf; Arulanantham: http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Arulanantham05242011.pdf.
Conversely, the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) have denounced the legislation, stating that: "The bill, H.R. 1932, would strip important due process protections of harmless individuals by needlessly increasing the government's already broad authority to detain noncitizens."  David Leopold, a past AILA President, explains: "The deprivation of liberty is a powerful tool that must be exercised carefully. DHS has exceptional latitude to detain noncitizens who are a flight risk or pose a danger to our communities. Those powers do not need further expansion." In 2010, the Department of Homeland Security detained nearly 400,000 immigrants at a cost of $2 billion.AILA InfoNet Doc. No. 11052460 (posted May. 24, 2011), http://www.aila.org/content/default.aspx?docid=35508 If H.R.1932 passes, this cost could increase exponentially. The constitutionality of the bill has been questioned. Joanne Lin, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), stated that the bill would authorize indefinite detention of immigrants without providing procedural safeguards.

From "Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio" ==> """
Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626 (1985), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that states can require an advertiser to disclose certain information without violating the advertiser's First Amendment free speech protections as long as the disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers.. The decision effected identified that some commercial speech may have weaker First Amendment free speech protections than non-commercial speech and that states can compel such commercial speech to protect their interests; future cases have relied on the "Zauderer standard" to determine the constitutionality of state laws that compel commercial speech as long as the information to be disclosed is "purely factual and uncontroversial".
Background
Philip Q. Zauderer was an attorney practicing in Columbus, Ohio. To expand his business, in 1981, he had an advertisement printed in The Columbus Citizen-Journal offering to represent clients charged with drunk driving, with language stating that their legal fees would be refunded if they were convicted of drunk driving. On the second day the ad was run, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel for the Supreme Court of Ohio contacted Zauderer, stating that the ad appeared to suggest he would represent criminal defendants on a contingent-fee basis, which violated the state's Code of Professional Responsibility. Zauderer immediately withdrew the ad and stated he would not take any cases from people responding to the ad.
Later, in 1982, Zauderer took another advertisement in several Ohio newspapers, this time offering his services on a contingent-fee basis for any women that may have been injured by the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device. His ad included an illustration of the Dalkon Shield, and descriptive language of the alleged injuries that women may have suffered from the device. While the ad successfully drew him clients, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel took further issue with this ad, and formally filed a complaint against Zauderer resulting from ads for violating several Ohio Disciplinary Rules. Among several complaints, the Office specifically called to the illustration and language that Zauderer used within the Dalkon ad as failing to be "dignified". Other violations asserted by the state including the misleading information on the drunk driving ad, how he offered his services in the Dalkon ad, and choice of language to represent his contingent-fee basis, including omission that clients may still be liable for costs, in and above attorney fees, even if they would lose the case. The Office specifically noted that they did not consider other information and advice in the Dalkon ad to be fraudulent or misleading.
At his hearing at the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline for the Ohio Supreme Court, Zauderer stated that Ohio's Disciplinary Rules related to the content of advertisements violated his rights to advertise under the First Amendment, as previously decided by Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, , and In re R.M.J., . The Board rejected Zauderer's defense, and on his appeal, the Supreme Court of Ohio upheld the conclusions from the Board, specifically noting that Bates and In re R.M.J. were aimed towards preventing deceptive advertising. The Supreme Court of Ohio also stated that In re R.M.J. suggested that states could regulate non-deceptive advertising to serve a narrow state interest; in this case, requiring disclosure of contingent-fee arrangements was deemed necessary by the state to assure potential clients would not misled.
Supreme Court
Zauderer petitioned to the Supreme Court on several issued raised by the case, which accepted the case and heard oral arguments on January 7, 1985. The Court issued its decision on May 25, 1985. While the Court reversed some of the disciplinary actions against Zauderer by the Supreme Court of Ohio, it affirmed that court's decision that the state could regulate commercial speech. With Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. not participating in the case, the opinion of a generally-unanimous count was written by Justice Byron White, joined in full by Justices Blackmun and Stevens, and in part by Brennan and Marshall (both who joined a concurrence in part and dissent in part) and in part by Burger, Rehnquist and O'Connor (who also joined in a separate concurrence in part and dissent in part).
The principal matter of Zauderer centered on the requirement of Ohio's Disciplinary Rules for disclosure of contingent-fee arrangements. White wrote:
The State has attempted only to prescribe what shall be orthodox in commercial advertising, and its prescription has taken the form of a requirement that appellant include in his advertising purely factual and uncontroversial information about the terms under which his services will be available. Because the extension of First Amendment protection to commercial speech is justified principally by the value to consumers of the information such speech provides, appellant's constitutionally protected interest in not providing any particular factual information in his advertising is minimal. . . . [B]ecause disclosure requirements trench much more narrowly on an advertiser's interests than do flat prohibitions on speech, “warning[s] or disclaimer[s] might be appropriately required . . . in order to dissipate the possibility of consumer confusion or deception.
Due to this reasoning, the Court upheld the disciplinary action against Zauderer for failing to disclose the contingent-fee terms from both ads, while following similar logic, found that the state had no protected interest against the use of factual illustrative material nor claims of representation, and overturned the Office's actions on these points.
Impact
Zauderer has led to the establishment of the "Zauderer standard" to determine when a state's interest in compelling parts of commercial speech is valid. This test employees the "purely factual and uncontroversial information" language from the Zauderer decision to judge if such disclosure requirements are constitutional compelled commercial speech. The standard is frequently used in cases involving the labeling of food or other products.
The Zauderer standard has generally been held for when the government is seeking to prevent deception, but within the 21st century, a number of cases heard at the Circuit courts have considered the Zauderer standard applied to government language that is not strictly to prevent deception, creating a precedent. Such cases include:
 American Meat Institute v. USDA, held in the D.C. Appeals Court, found that Zauderer applied to the government's demand for meat packagers to include the country of origin of their product on packaging, even when considering the result of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, .
 National Electrical Manufacturers Association v. Sorrell, held in the Second Circuit, found that Zauderer applied to the addition of disclosure labels warning consumers that fluorescent light bulbs contained mercury and should be disposed as hazardous waste.
 CTIA—The Wireless Association v. City of Berkeley, held in the Ninth Circuit, used Zauderer to justify the constitutionality of city laws requiring cell phone providers to warn users about potentially receiving higher-than-recommended levels of radiation if they keep their cell phone in their pockets.
The Supreme Court case of National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra  established that there is a limit to how much Zauderer can apply; the Court ruled that required signage to be posted at crisis pregnancy centers notifying potential patients of state-provided abortion services did not fall under the Zauderer standard as it was unjustified and imposed a burden on a specific targeted set of speakers. The Court subsequently ordered the CTIA case, which had been petitioned to the Supreme Court, to be reconsidered in light of the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates decision.  The appeals court reconsidered and reaffirmed its previous conclusion, stating that Berkeley’s warning is “literally true,” promotes public health and does not require retailers to post messages that violate their beliefs. The Supreme Court then rejected a subsequent telecommunications industry challenge.

From "Zedner v. United States" ==> """
Zedner v. United States, 547 U.S. 489 (2006), was a United States Supreme Court case involving the right to a speedy trial.  Justice Samuel Alito, writing for a unanimous Court, ruled that a defendant cannot prospectively waive the protections of the Speedy Trial Act.18 U.S.C. 3161, et seq.  Justice Antonin Scalia filed a partial concurrence, objecting to Alito's use of legislative history.
 Background 
Jacob Zedner was arrested in 1996 for attempting to open bank accounts with a fake $10 Million bond issued by the fictitious “Ministry of Finance of U.S.A.”  He was indicted by a grand jury in the Eastern District of New York for trying to pass counterfeit Treasury securities on April 4, 1996.  The District Court granted a continuance until September 6, then granted another continuance until November 8.  Due to difficulties in arranging a trial schedule, the judge suggested that the defendant waive his rights under the Speedy Trial Act "for all time."  The defendant and his attorney agreed to do so.
The case continued to languish for the next four years, during which time the defendant changed lawyers, was examined by a psychiatrist, and ultimately decided to proceed pro se.  On March 7, 2001, while his competency to stand trial was being examined, the defendant moved to have the case dismissed for failure to comply with the Speedy Trial Act.  The District Court denied his motion, and on April 7, 2003, the trial finally began.
 Procedural history 
On April 7, 2003, after a trial in the District Court, a jury found Zedner guilty and the judge sentenced him to 63 months imprisonment.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the verdict, including the waiver of speedy trial rights, and noted that any error was harmless.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if the waiver was effective.
 Issue 
The Speedy Trial Act requires that a trial begin within seventy days of the indictment, but provides for a variety of exceptions.  If the trial does not begin on time, the defendant may move for dismissal, which the court must (under most circumstances) grant.
 Parties' arguments 
The government contended that the defendant could waive his rights under the Act.  The defendant did so, but then contended that such a waiver was unlawful.  The issue had not been addressed in earlier cases.See New York v. Hill, 528 U.S. 110, 117
 Opinion of the Court 
The Court unanimously held that the defendant was correct; one may not prospectively waive one's rights under the Speedy Trial Act.  Justice Alito wrote that the purpose of the Act is not simply to protect the defendant's rights, but to protect the public's interest in a speedy trial.  For that reason, the Act excludes certain delays even at the request of the defendant.See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 3161(h)(8)(A).
Alito next discussed the legislative history of the Act; this is the section in which Justice Scalia declined to concur.A discussion of this divergence may be found at Orin Kerr's blog.  The history follows the explicit terms of the Act, stating that the public has an interest in quick resolutions to criminal charges.  Alito went on to discuss the lack of a provision for prospective waiver in the statute.
The Court then rejected the government's alternate theory of the case: that the defendant, having agreed to the waiver, is now estopped from challenging it.  The Court declines to apply estoppel doctrines, stating that it would "entirely swallow the Act's no-waiver policy."  Furthermore, the Court found, since the district court requested the waiver, rather than the defendant, estoppel is not applicable.  In addition, the harmless error doctrine does not apply to speedy trial violations.
 Concurrence 
Justice Scalia concurred in everything except Part III-A-2, the section on legislative history.

From "Zelman v. Simmons-Harris" ==> """
Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639 (2002), was a 5–4 decision of the United States Supreme Court that upheld an Ohio program that used school vouchers. The Court decided that the program did not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, even if the vouchers could be used for private religious schools.
Background
The public schools in many of the poorer parts of Cleveland were deemed failures, and the legislature enacted the Pilot Project Scholarship Program in an effort to address the problem.Zelman, 536 U.S. at 644–45. Ohio had been running the program, which allowed parents of qualified students in the Cleveland School District, from the 1996–97 school year, to use public money to pay for tuition at private schools in the program, which included religious schools.
Of the 56 private schools that agreed to the program, 46 were sectarian. The program aimed to improve the low educational performance of the students in the school district. 
The program provided tuition vouchers for up to $2,250 a year to some parents of students in the school district to attend participating public or private schools in the city and neighboring suburbs. The program also allocated tutorial aid for students who remained in public schools.
The vouchers were distributed to parents according to their financial needs. The parents chose where to enroll their children. Since the number of students applying to the program greatly exceeded the number of vouchers available, recipients were chosen by lottery from among the eligible families. In the 1999–2000 school year, 82% of the participating private schools had a religious affiliation. None of the adjacent suburban public schools joined the program. 96% of the students receiving vouchers were enrolled in religiously affiliated schools and 60% were from low-income families, at or below the poverty line.
Participating schools were not permitted to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic background. They are also not allowed to "advocate or foster unlawful behavior or teach hatred of any person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion." A group of Ohio taxpayers then filed an action against Susan Zelman, the superintendent of public education in Ohio, by pleading that the program violated the Establishment Clause. Simmons-Harris, along with other residents of the Cleveland area, argued that the government "could not pay tuition for students to attend religious school." The local federal district court, in addition to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, ruled in favor of Simmons-Harris.
Zelman continued the case and appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which sustained the voucher program.
 First Amendment 
The First Amendment protects the rights to freedom of religion and to freedom of expression from government interference. The First Amendment comes into play because the taxpayers of Ohio said that the program was a violation of the Establishment Clause, one of the two clauses of the First Amendment. The Establishment Clause guarantees freedom of religion and strictly prohibits the government from passing any legislation to establish an official religion or preferring one religion over another; it thus enforces the "separation of church and state."
Since the program was designed to provide no incentive for religious private, secular private, or public schools, the taxpayers did not want their money to pay for the children who wanted religious schooling.
 Majority opinion 
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the majority opinion. He declared that the school voucher program was not in violation of the Establishment Clause. He also deemed that government support for religion was constitutional if it did not occur de jure but de facto and also failed to specify or to encourage religious schools. Cleveland's program was declared to be religiously neutral and to be giving parents the benefit of true private choice.
Rehnquist referred to the program's aims as strictly secular assistance for the poor, low-performing children, who would be otherwise stuck in the communities that were failed by the school district.
Moreover, the issue was whether the school voucher program encouraged or inhibited religion directly. The Court used its precedent in Mueller v. Allen (1983) that aid could constitutionally be given to parents but not to schools. The Court found that there were thus no religious advances, in reference to the Establishment Clause.
The likelihood of religious private schools in the area at the particular time and the decision of the student were not fundamental in the constitutionality of the voucher program. The vouchers were available to a general class of citizens who met the needed criteria and were given a personal, independent choice of voucher-accepting schools. As a state plan to make a better education readily available for poor students, there was no religious bias. Offering parents the choice to use the voucher for tutorial aid in public school, a scholarship for religious or nonreligious private schools or magnet schools, or enrollment in community college made no incentive to pick a religious private school.
If parents wanted to pick religious schools for their children to attend, their choice should have no bearing on the government. The incidental advancement of a religious mission was reasonably inferable to the individual, not the government. The government's role ended with the expense of beliefs. 
Rehnquist continued that the program encouraged the true private choice of the family. By basing school vouchers strictly on the economic means of the student and on geographic location, religious concerns were factored. Another primary issue of the case concerned the 96% of scholarship recipients who attended religious private school. The Court noted that the program actually provided disincentives for religious schools: the private school received only half of that allocated to community schools and only a third of that allocated to magnet schools.
 Concurring opinions 
Justice O'Connor and Justice Thomas added comments when they both delivered a separate concurring opinion to the majority.
O'Connor strongly believed that the program made no real and clear distinction between religious and non-religious schools and that both were rational education alternatives. O'Connor mentioned in her concurrence that many beneficiaries used community and private non-religious schools. That and the fact that true private school choice was available made the program not technically violate the Establishment Clause.
She focused on a few specific points. First, like the majority, she emphasized that its inquiry required an evaluation of all reasonable educational options that Ohio provided to the Cleveland school system, regardless of whether they were formally made available in the same section of the Ohio Code as the voucher program. She insisted that the facts were critical in cases arising under the Establishment Clause by saying that failing to look at all of the educational options would "ignore how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions."
Also, she believed that the "decision, when considered in light of other longstanding government programs that impact religious organizations and our prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence, [does not] mark a dramatic break from the past."
Finally, she believed, "The share of public resources that reach religious schools is not... as significant as respondents suggest.... $8.2 million is no small sum, it pales in comparison to the amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide religious institutions" without there being any serious question regarding the constitutionality of such support. Her conclusion in the case, like in many other cases, was tied closely to the facts of the case.
Thomas's opinion focused on the civil rights implications of the case:
"Frederick Douglass once said that '[e]ducation... means emancipation. It means light and liberty. It means the uplifting of the soul of man into the glorious light of truth, the light by which men can only be made free.' Today many of our inner-city public schools deny emancipation to urban minority students. Despite this Court's observation nearly 50 years ago in Brown v. Board of Education, that 'it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education,' urban children have been forced into a system that continually fails them. These cases present an example of such failures. Besieged by escalating financial problems and declining academic achievement, the Cleveland City School District was in the midst of an academic emergency when Ohio enacted its scholarship program."
Thomas gave another string concurrence to this Supreme Court decision: "The protection of religious liberty using the Fourteenth Amendment is legitimate, but to use the Establishment Clause to prevent the operation of a perfectly neutral program concerning school choice is not." Thomas simply asserted that all this program did was essentially provide an educational opportunity to a range of disadvantaged minority children, the importance of it all.
 Dissenting opinions
Justice Stevens and Justice Souter both wrote a separate dissenting opinion.
Justice Stevens's dissenting opinion focused on the method by which the majority reached its conclusions. In his view, the Court "should ignore three factual matters that are discussed at length." Specifically, he argued that the Court should not consider the severe educational crisis that confronted the school district when Ohio enacted its voucher program, the wide range of choices that have been made available to students within the public school system, or the voluntary character of the private choice to prefer a private religious education over a public secular education.
Justice Souter's dissenting opinion presented the voucher program as using the taxpayers for religious and secular instruction and card to the verdict of a similar case. Everson v. Board of Education decided that no tax could be used to support religious means. Because Ohio's school voucher program offered aid to those who wished to attend religious private schools, it directly violated Everson. Furthermore, allowing vouchers to be used with religious schooling advanced secular learning and institutions. Souter expresses that ignoring the ruling of Everson ignored the importance of neutrality and private choice. Moreover, disregarding Everson promoted a new way of thinking that held government aid as insignificant in constitutional grounds. He commented on the voucher money that was going to religious schools as a reflection of free choice by families: "The 96.6% reflects, instead the fact that too few nonreligious school desks are available and few, but religious schools can afford to accept more than a handful of voucher students.... For the overwhelming number of children in the voucher scheme, the only alternative to the public schools is religious." Souter strongly voiced his denunciation on the fact that the decision undermined the point of prohibiting religious establishments. He claimed that it was all to save religion from its own corruption, but participation in the program depended on adopting rules that might come in forms of religious discrimination.
Private choice test
Moderate Justices Kennedy and O'Connor and conservative Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas combined to form the majority.
The Ohio program passed a five-part test that was developed by the Court in the case, the private choice test. It states that a voucher program, to be constitutional, must meet all five criteria:
The program must have a valid secular purpose.
Aid must go to parents, not schools.
A broad class of beneficiaries must be covered.
The program must be neutral with respect to religion.
There must be adequate nonreligious options.
The court ruled that the Ohio program met the test:
The valid secular purpose of the program was "providing educational assistance to poor children in a demonstrably failing public school system."
The vouchers were given to the parents.
The "broad class" was all students enrolled in currently failing programs.
Parents who received vouchers were not required to enroll in a religious-based school.
There were other public schools in adjoining districts as well as nonreligious private schools in the Cleveland area that would accept the vouchers.
Rehnquist, writing for the majority, stated, "The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual aid recipients not the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits." In theory, there was no need for parents to use religious schools, and if the law did not especially encourage the use of vouchers for religious schools, the fact that most parents chose parochial schools was irrelevant. Funding was given to the parents to disburse as they chose, but in Lemon v. Kurtzman, the funding at question was given directly to the schools, which failed the test.
In his concurring opinion, Thomas emphasized that voucher programs, like the one in the case, were essential because "failing urban public schools disproportionately affect minority children most in need of educational opportunity." He stated that vouchers and other forms of publicly funded private school choice are necessary to give families an opportunity to enroll their children in better, private schools. Otherwise, "the core purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment" would be frustrated.
The dissenting opinions disagreed, and Stevens wrote that "the voluntary character of the private choice to prefer a parochial education over an education in the public school system seems to me quite irrelevant to the question whether the government's choice to pay for religious indoctrination is constitutionally permissible." Souter questioned how the Court could both keep Everson as precedent and decide the case as it did. He also found that religious education and secular education could not be separated, which would automatically violate the Establishment Clause. The establishment clause claims that State are passing laws in correlation to religion. 
Blaine Amendments
Most state constitutions have so-called Blaine Amendments, which specifically forbid state funding of religious and/or sectarian education.  As a question of state, not federal, law, Ohio's Blaine Amendment was not considered by federal courts in the case.
Florida's Opportunity Scholarship voucher program was ruled unconstitutional on Blaine grounds in a split 8-5 First District Court of Appeal ruling in Nov. 2004. The issue was argued before the Florida Supreme Court in 2005, with voucher advocates hoping to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court in an effort to invalidate Blaine Amendments nationwide, following the Zelman decision. However, the Florida Supreme Court sidestepped the issue altogether and declared the program unconstitutional on separate grounds in an effort to avoid U.S. Supreme Court scrutiny.

From "Zemel v. Rusk" ==> """
Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1 (1965), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding the right to travel and area restrictions on passports (travel to Cuba), holding that the Secretary of State is statutorily authorized to refuse to validate the passports of United States citizens for travel to Cuba and that the exercise of that authority is constitutionally permissible.
 Background 
Prior to 1961, no passport was required for travel anywhere in the Western Hemisphere. On January 3 of that year, the United States broke diplomatic and consular relations with Cuba. On January 16, the Department of State eliminated Cuba from the area for which passports were not required, and declared all outstanding United States passports (except those held by persons already in Cuba) to be invalid for travel to or in Cuba "unless specifically endorsed for such travel under the authority of the Secretary of State." A companion press release stated that the Department contemplated granting exceptions to "persons whose travel may be regarded as being in the best interests of the United States, such as newsmen or businessmen with previously established business interests."
Through an exchange of letters in early 1962, Louis Zemel, a citizen of the United States and holder of an otherwise valid passport, applied to the State Department to have his passport validated for travel to Cuba as a tourist. His request was denied. On October 30, 1962, he renewed the request, stating that the purpose of the proposed trip was "to satisfy my curiosity about the state of affairs in Cuba and to make me a better informed citizen." The request again was denied on the ground that the purpose of the trip did not meet the previously prescribed standards for such travel.
On December 7, 1962, Zemel instituted this suit against the Secretary of State and the Attorney General in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, seeking a judgment declaring (1) that he was entitled under the Constitution and laws of the United States to travel to Cuba and to have his passport validated for that purpose; (2) that his travel to Cuba and the use of his passport for that purpose would not violate any statute, regulation, or passport restriction; (3) that the Secretary's restrictions upon travel to Cuba were invalid; (4) that the Passport Act of 1926 and § 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 were unconstitutional; (5) that the Secretary's refusal to grant him a passport valid for Cuba violated rights guaranteed him by the Constitution and the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, and (6) that denial of the passport endorsement without a formal hearing violated his rights under the Fifth Amendment. (This procedural claim was abandoned in the District Court and not raised on appeal.) The complaint also requested that the Secretary be directed to validate appellant's passport for travel to Cuba, and that the Secretary and the Attorney General be enjoined from interfering with such travel. In his amended complaint, Zemel added to his constitutional attack on the 1926 and 1952 Acts a prayer that the Secretary and the Attorney General be enjoined from enforcing them.
On Zemel's motion and over the objection of appellees, a three-judge court was convened. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the court, by a divided vote, granted the Secretary of State's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action against the Attorney General, 228 F.Supp. 65 (D.C.D.Conn., 1964). The case was heard on direct appeal from the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1253 (1958 ed).
 Decision 
The Court in a divided opinion held that the Secretary of State is statutorily authorized to refuse to validate the passports of United States citizens for travel to Cuba and that the exercise of that authority is constitutionally permissible.
 Majority opinion 
Chief Justice Earl Warren, writing for the majority, held that the three-judge trial court was properly convened and that the Court therefore had jurisdiction over the appeal, citing Idlewild Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, 370 U.S. 713.
The Secretary of State's refusal to validate appellant's passport for travel to Cuba was supported by the authority granted by Congress in the Passport Act of 1926 because its language was broad enough to authorize area restrictions, and there was no legislative history indicating an intent to exclude such restrictions from the grant of authority. Further, during the decade preceding the passage of the Act, the Executive had imposed both peacetime and wartime area restrictions.
It distinguished from Kent v. Dulles because here it found an administrative practice sufficiently substantial and consistent to warrant the conclusion that Congress had implicitly approved it. The Court rejected Zemel's contention that the cases of refusal of passports generally fell into only two categories: 1) questions pertinent to the citizenship of the applicant and his allegiance to the United States and 2) the question whether the applicant was participating in illegal conduct, trying to escape the toils of the law, promoting passport frauds, or otherwise engaging in conduct which would violate the laws of the United States, noting that the issue involved in Kent was whether a citizen could be denied a passport because of his political beliefs or associations but that here the Secretary refused to validate appellant's passport not because of any characteristic peculiar to appellant, but rather because of foreign policy considerations affecting all citizens.
Regarding his Fifth Amendment due process right to travel claim and his First Amendment right to freedom of expression and association, the Court held that the requirements of due process were a function not only of the extent of the governmental restriction imposed, but also of the extent of the necessity for the restriction, citing Kent v. Dulles, Aptheker v. Secretary of State, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Art. 13 (quoted. S.Doc. No. 123, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1157); and Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 and that this case was supported by the weightiest considerations of national security. Zemel's assertion that the Secretary's refusal to validate his passport for travel to Cuba denied him rights guaranteed by the First Amendment was different from that which was raised in Kent v. Dulles and Aptheker v. Secretary of State because the refusal to validate his passport did not result from any expression or association on his part; he was not being forced to choose between membership in an organization and freedom to travel.
Although Zemel's contention that a First Amendment right was involved in the Secretary's refusal to validate passports for Cuba because it acted as an inhibition to the free the flow of information concerning that country, it was rather a factor to be considered in determining whether appellant was denied due process of law, under the Fifth Amendment citing again Kent v. Dulles and Aptheker v. Secretary of State. It was an inhibition of action and that the right to speak and publish does not carry with it the unrestrained right to gather information.
The Court also rejected Zemel's challenge that the 1926 Act did not contain sufficiently definite standards for the formulation of travel controls by the Executive. Executive authority over matters of foreign affairs must of necessity be painted with a brush broader than that customarily wielded in domestic areas because of the changeable and explosive nature of contemporary international relations, and the fact that the Executive is immediately privy to information which cannot be swiftly presented to, evaluated by, and acted upon by the legislature, citing United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., 299 U.S. 304. The passport refusals and restrictions adopted here could fairly be argued were adopted by Congress in light of prior administrative practice and thus did not constitute an invalid delegation, citing Kent v. Dulles.
Finally, the Court refused to enter an order enjoining the Secretary and the Attorney General from interfering with such travel. It found the lower court had been correct in refusing to reach the issue of criminal liability for unauthorized travel to Cuba because it was not clear if or how Zemel planned to travel to Cuba and whether criminal charges would be instituted against him if he did.
 Dissent 
Justice Hugo Black, dissenting, refused to accept the Government's argument that the President had "inherent" power to make regulations governing the issuance and use of passports, citing Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579. He rejected the Government's contention that the passport regulations here involved were valid, because the discretion delegated to the President and Secretary of State were unbridled, amounting to "delegation running riot," citing Justice Cardozo in A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495. In Justice Black's view, the 1926 Act gave the lawmaking power of Congress to the Secretary and the President, and that it therefore violated the constitutional command that "all" legislative power be vested in the Congress.
Justice William O. Douglas, with whom Justice Goldberg concurred, dissenting, arguing for strict scrutiny, invoked the peripheral rights of the citizen under the First Amendment, citing Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 and Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500 and NAACP v. Alabama, 377 U.S. 288. Restrictions on the right to travel in times of peace should be so particularized that a First Amendment right is not precluded unless some clear countervailing national interest stands in the way of its assertion.
Justice Goldberg, in a lengthy dissent, agreed with the Court that Congress had the constitutional power to impose area restrictions on travel, consistent with constitutional guarantees, but rejected the Court's holding that Congress had exercised this power. Moreover, he did not believe that the Executive has inherent authority to impose area restrictions in time of peace.
Justice Goldberg held that neither the legislative history nor administrative practice supported the Court's view that when Congress reenacted the 1856 provision in 1926, it intended to grant the Executive authority to impose area restrictions and that the only area restrictions imposed between 1856 and 1926 arose out of the First World War. In 1926 Congress reenacted, in virtually identical terms, the 1856 statute, the sole purpose of which was to centralize passport issuance in the hands of the Secretary of State in order to overcome the abuses and chaos caused by the fact that, prior to the passage of the statute, numerous unauthorized persons issued passports and travel documents.
He noted that more numerous instances of restriction on travel because of political beliefs and associations in wartime were insufficient to show that Congress intended to grant the Secretary authority to curtail such travel in peacetime, holding that Kent v. Dulles should be controlling here. Justice Goldberg felt that the statute was simply inapplicable to area restrictions because it could not be presumed that Congress, without focusing upon the complex problems involved, resolved them by adopting a broad and sweeping statute which, in the Court's view, conferred unlimited discretion upon the Executive, and which made no distinctions reconciling the rights of the citizen to travel with the government's legitimate needs.

From "Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc." ==> """
Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc. is the caption of several United States Supreme Court patent–related decisions, the most significant of which is a 1969 patent–antitrust and patent–misuse decision concerning the levying of patent royalties on unpatented products.
1969 Case
In Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100 (1969),. Hazeltine had required an unwilling Zenith to pay a percentage of all its sales of electronic equipment in order to be granted a license under Hazeltine's patents. The Supreme Court held that requiring a patent licensee to pay a percentage of its total patented and non-patented product sales as a condition of the license was misuse. On the other hand, the Court said, if the parties adopted this method of determining royalties ("total–sales royalties") without coercion and for mutual convenience, such as because of the difficulty in making a precise accounting, then the expedient was not misuse.
Zenith had sued Hazeltine for a declaration of misuse and treble antitrust damages. It was therefore necessary for the Court to determine whether coercive total–sales royalties was not only misuse but a basis for antitrust damages as well. The Court ruled that for Hazeltine to be liable for antitrust treble damages, the other requirements of such an action must be met—such as sufficient anti-competitive impact.395 U.S. at 140. This holding reaffirmed a line of Supreme Court patent–misuse decisions holding that the competitive impact of a restrictive practice may fall short of an antitrust violation and nonetheless be misuse.See, e.g., .
1971 Case
The case was brought to the Supreme Court again in 1971. In Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc.,. the Supreme Court reversed the Seventh Circuit's remand decision in the preceding 1969 case. In its decision on remand, the district court had found an antitrust violation—participating in foreign patent pools that excluded Zenith from selling in the U.S. market—and awarded damages to Zenith. The district court rejected a statute of limitations defense. On appeal to the Seventh Circuit, it reversed on statute of limitations grounds; it remanded for a reduction of the award because part of the damages resulted from conduct that occurred outside the statute of limitations. The Supreme Court reversed the Seventh Circuit, instructing it to reinstate the district court judgment. The Supreme Court held that the statute of limitations had been tolled by a government suit, even though Zenith was not involved in that suit and Hazeltine was not named as a defendant co–conspirator.401 U.S. at 336–38.
In establishing precedent, the Court held that Zenith was still entitled to damages for the lasting and future effects of conspiratorial conduct, even if the statute of limitations were not tolled. "Generally, a cause of action accrues and the statute begins to run when a defendant commits an act that injures a plaintiff's business.,401 U.S. at 808. that is, "each time a plaintiff is injured by an act of the defendants a cause of action accrues to him to recover the damages caused by that act and that, as to those damages, the statute of limitations runs from the commission of the act." However, this applies only to the damages caused immediately. When there are future injuries "that might arise from the conduct sued on are unrecoverable if the fact of their accrual is speculative or their amount and nature unprovable," then the statute does not begin to run on the injuries until they occur and can be ascertained. Accordingly, the statute of limitations did not bar the recovery Zenith sought.401 U.S. at 341–02.

From "ZF Automotive U. S., Inc. v. Luxshare, Ltd." ==> """
ZF Automotive U. S., Inc. v. Luxshare, Ltd., 596 U.S. ___ (2022), is a decision of the United States Supreme Court on the scope of §1782 of Title 28 of the United States Code. The issue of statutory interpretation for the Court was whether a private commercial arbitral tribunal constitutes a "foreign or international tribunal" under  and therefore empowers federal districts courts to compel the production by persons subject to their jurisdiction of documents and testimony for such tribunals.
The case was decided together with AlixPartners LLP v The Fund for Protection of Investor Rights in Foreign States which concerned an investor-state arbitration.
In a unanimous decision, the Court ruled that a private arbitral tribunal overseas is not a "foreign or international tribunal" under .  The Court also decided that the investor-state arbitral tribunal in the AlixPartners case was not a foreign or international tribunal for the purposes of §1782.
 Background 
In ZF Automotive US v. Luxshare, the parties referred a dispute as to alleged fraudulent conduct to a commercial arbitration panel in Germany pursuant to an arbitration clause in the underlying contract.
Luxshare filed an ex parte application under §1782 seeking discovery. The District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan granted the application, ordering ZF to produce documents in accordance and ordering an officer to attend for deposition. ZF moved to quash the subpoenas, but the ruling by the District Court was upheld by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.
In AlixPartners, a Russian investor in a failed bank in Lithuania, SNORAS, claimed that Lithuania had expropriated certain investments from SNORAS. After finding that the bank had not met its obligations, the Lithuanian central bank nationalised SNORAS and appointed Simon Freakley, the CEO of a consulting firm, AlixPartners as temporary administrator.  SNORAS was subsequently declared insolvent.  The investor assigned his claim to The Fund for Protection of Investor Rights in Foreign States, a Russian Corporation, which initiated arbitration proceedings against Lithuania in accordance with the bilateral investment treaty between Lithuania and Russia. The Fund chose an ad hoc arbitration in accordance with Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).
The Fund filed a §1782 application. AlixPartners argued that an ad hoc arbitration panel was not a "foreign or international tribunal" but the District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the application. This decision was upheld by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
The Second Circuit had previously decided that a private arbitral panel was not a "foreign or international tribunal" in Natl. Broadcasting Co. v. Bear Stearns Co.  The Second Circuit took a different view as to the ad hoc tribunal in AlixPartners. There were conflicting decisions on the issue in various Appellate Circuits.Servotronics, Inc. v. Boeing Co., 954 F. 3d 209 (CA4 2020); Abdul Latif, 939 F. 3d 710, with National Broadcasting Co. v. Bear Stearns & Co., 165 F. 3d 184 (CA2 1999); Republic of Kazakhstan v.Biedermann Int’l, 168 F. 3d 880 (CA5 1999); Servotronics, Inc. v. Rolls-Royce PLC, 975 F. 3d 689 (CA7 2020); In re Guo, 965 F.3d 96 (CA2 2020)
In both cases, the defendant applied to the Supreme Court of the United States for certiorari (to review the decisions of the Appellate Courts).
 Supreme Court 
To resolve the split between Circuit Appellate Courts and to address the definition of "foreign or international tribunal", the Supreme Court granted Certiorari and consolidated the two cases on November 5, 2021. The Court heard oral arguments on March 23, 2022. On June 13, 2022, the court ruled unanimously to reverse the rulings of both Courts of Appeal. Justice Barrett wrote the unanimous opinion.
 Opinion of the Court 
The Court held that a "foreign or international tribunal" should be a tribunal belonging to a foreign nation. The Court accepted that the broad definition of "tribunal" might encompass private adjudicatory bodies, but the phrase "foreign or international" preceding the word "tribunal" has a governmental connotation, which shows that the tribunal should have sovereign authority conferred by a nation. Therefore, Justice Barrett wrote, "foreign tribunals" and "international tribunals" complement each other.  The former is a tribunal imbued with governmental authority by one nation, and the latter is a tribunal imbued with governmental authority by multiple nations.
The Court regarded its interpretation of §1782 as consistent with congress antecedents and added that extending §1782 to include private dispute resolution bodies might cause "tension" with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), as §1782 permits a larger scope of discovery than the FAA does. 
The Court concluded thus (at page 16):   
"In sum, only a governmental or intergovernmental adjudicative body constitutes a “foreign or international tribunal” under §1782. Such bodies are those that exercise governmental authority conferred by one nation or multiple nations. Neither the private commercial arbitral panel in the first case nor the ad hoc arbitration panel in the second case qualifies."
The Court (at page 15) left open the possibility that some investor-state arbitrations might qualify as foreign tribunals, on a case by case basis, holding as follows:
"None of this forecloses the possibility that sovereigns might imbue an ad hoc arbitration panel with official authority. Governmental and intergovernmental bodies may take many forms, and we do not attempt to prescribe how they should be structured. The point is only that a body does not possess governmental authority just because nations agree in a treaty to submit to arbitration before it. The relevant question is whether the nations intended that the ad hoc panel exercise governmental authority. And here, all indications are that they did not."
 Subsequent Caselaw 
Following ZF, in In re Alpene 2022 WL 15497008 (Oct. 27, 2022), the Eastern District of New York held that section 1782 discovery was not available in relation to an investor-State arbitration conducted under the auspices of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The Court found that there was “insufficient support” for the argument that Malta and China (the two relevant States) had “intended to imbue the ICSID arbitration panel with government authority".
The Southern District of New York reached the same conclusion as to an ICSID arbitral panel in In Re: Application of Webuild S.p.A. and Sacyr S.A. 2022 WL 17807321 (Dec. 19, 2022).

From "Ziglar v. Abbasi" ==> """
Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U.S. ___ (2017), is a Supreme Court of the United States case in which the Court determined, by a vote of 4-2, that non-U.S. citizens detained in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks cannot recover monetary damages from high level federal officials for the conditions of their confinement.. The case was consolidated with Hastey v. Abbasi, and Ashcroft v. Abbasi. It was argued on January 18, 2017.
The class action civil lawsuit was filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) against the then-Attorney General John Ashcroft, FBI Director Robert Mueller, former INS Commissioner James Ziglar, and employees of the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York, on the behalf of a number of Muslim, South Asian, and Arab non-citizens who, under the pretext of immigration violations, were held in detention for several months.
Background
During the immediate U.S. government response to the September 11 attacks, federal officials sought out and detained illegally present aliens, arresting 762 in all, 60% in the New York area.  Aliens "of high interest" to national security would not be deported but were instead "held until cleared" by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  84 of these aliens were held by the MDC.
On April 17, 2002, plaintiffs sued in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleging that the United States Department of Justice and MDC's behavior violated both the Equal Protection Clause and the substantive due process clause, and that they had a right to sue under an implied cause of action created by Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents (1971).Sonja Marrett, Note, Turkmen v. Hasty: The Second Circuit Holds Highest Ranking Law Enforcement Officials Accountable for Post-9/11 Policies Infringing on Constitutional Rights, 57 B.C.L. Rev. 194 (2016).
The lawsuit charges that the Immigration and Naturalization Service unlawfully held the plaintiffs several months after the completion of immigration cases brought against them to allow the FBI to investigate potential links to terrorism, an alleged violation of their First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment rights. The suit additionally alleges that the conditions of detainment of these prisoners, as well as the length of detainment, violated their rights, as prisoners were held in the Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit (ADMAX SHU); deprived contact with their attorneys, families, and friends; prevented from the practice of their religions; and treated inhumanely in various ways, including being verbally and physically abused. David D. Cole, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, is one of the attorneys on the case.  Plaintiffs' trial attorney from CCR was Rachel Meeropol, a granddaughter of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
On June 14, 2006, U.S. District Judge John Gleeson refused to dismiss the plaintiffs’ substantive due process and equal protection claims.  In February 2008, the case was reviewed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, including then-Circuit Judge Sonia Sotomayor.  On December 18, 2009, a two judge panel of the Second Circuit affirmed in an unsigned per curiam decision, with Sotomayor not participating due to her elevation to the Supreme Court of the United States.Turkmen v. Ashcroft, 589 F.3d 542 (2d Cir. 2009).  The Second Circuit remanded to Judge Gleeson for further consideration under the new pleading standards created by Ashcroft v. Iqbal (2009), a separate case regarding conditions at the MDC.
On November 3, 2009, the Center for Constitutional Rights announced that the six Metropolitan Detention Center plaintiffs had settled their claims against the United States for 1.26 million dollars.
Plaintiffs eventually filed four amended complaints, incorporating by reference AprilU.S. Dep't of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, The September 11 Detainees: A Review of the Treatment of Aliens Held on Immigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation of the September 11 Attacks (April 2003) and December 2003U.S. Dep't of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, Supplemental Report on September 11 Detainees' Allegations of Abuse at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York (Dec. 2003) United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General reports investigating the abuses at MDC.  On January 15, 2013, Judge Gleeson dismissed all claims against the federal DOJ defendants but denied the MDC defendants' motions to dismiss the constitutional conditions of confinement claims, the unreasonable strip search claim, and the conspiracy claim.Turkmen v. Ashcroft, 915 F. Supp. 2d 314 (E.D.N.Y. 2013).
On June 17, 2015, the Second Circuit ruled that the case could proceed.  Second Circuit Judges Rosemary S. Pooler and Richard Wesley affirmed Judge Gleeson with regard to the MDC defendants but reversed with regard to his dismissal of the claims against the DOJ defendants, over dissenting Judge Reena Raggi's argument that the DOJ defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.Turkmen v. Hasty, 789 F.3d 218 (2d Cir. 2015).  On December 11, 2015, a judge's request for rehearing en banc was denied by an equally divided circuit, with Judges Raggi, Dennis Jacobs, José A. Cabranes, Peter W. Hall, Debra Ann Livingston and Christopher F. Droney dissenting.Turkmen v. Hasty, 808 F.3d 197 (2d Cir. 2015)(joint dissent from denial of rehearing en banc).
Supreme Court
On February 29 and April 1, 2016, Circuit Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg granted the Solicitor General of the United States’s applications to extend the deadline to file a petition for a writ of certiorari.  On October 11, 2016, the Supreme Court agreed to review the case, with Justices Sotomayor and Elena Kagan recusing themselves.  Commentators were not optimistic for the plaintiffs, noting that the Supreme Court had granted all eight of the government's most recent requests to review counterterrorism cases it had lost below, and that the plaintiffs had never then won.  On January 18, 2017, one hour of oral argument was heard, where Ian Heath Gershengorn, the acting Solicitor General of the United States, appeared for the federal petitioners, a private attorney appeared for the MDC Warden, and the CCR’s Meeropol appeared for the detainees.
Opinion of the Court
On June 19, 2017, the Supreme Court delivered judgment in favor of the federal officials, reversing in part, vacating in part, and remanding by a vote of 4-2.  Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined fully by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, and partially by Justice Clarence Thomas, found that the implied cause of action created by Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents (1971) should not be extended to reach the federal officials' detention policy.The Supreme Court, 2016 Term — Leading Cases, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 313 (2017).
The Court began by recounting the history of the Bivens remedy, noting that the Court has since only extended it twice, in 1979 for gender discrimination and in 1980 for cruel and unusual punishment.  Calling that era an "ancien regime", the Court explained that it is now more mindful of separation of powers by looking for clear legislative intent before allowing claimants to seek damages.
If a claim arises in a new context to Bivens, then some special factor must be identified that makes the judiciary better suited than the legislature to decide that there is a new cause of action.  The Court first found that the claims regarding the federal government's detention policy were in a new context because they bore little resemblance to familiar Bivens claims.  Next, the Court found that there was no special factor calling for judicial intervention, highlighting that the claimed damages regard national security decisions by high level Executive Branch officials in response to a terrorist attack, that there was Congressional silence in response, and that alternative relief was available to the detainees through an injunction or the writ of habeas corpus.  As such, the detainees could not sue the federal officials.
The Court next found that the claims of detainee abuse against MDC Warden Hasty were in a new context to Bivens because prior precedent regarded the prison abuse of convicted felons in violation of the Eighth Amendment, rather than the detainees’ claims under the Fifth Amendment.  The majority remanded the claims against Warden Hastey to the lower court for it to analyze any special factors.  Finally, the Court granted each defendant qualified immunity on the civil conspiracy claim, acknowledging without resolving the longstanding circuit split regarding the impossibility of conspiring within a single government department.
Justice Thomas's concurrence in part and concurrence in judgment
Thomas refused to join the paragraph in the opinion of the Court remanding the lawsuit against MDC Warden Hasty. Thomas also expressed concern about the precedents which establish the doctrine of qualified immunity, which he considered at odds with the common-law text of the statute and "substitute[s] our own policy preferences for the mandates of Congress."
Justice Breyer's dissent
Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, respectfully dissented.  Breyer disagreed strongly enough to read his dissent aloud from the bench at the opinion announcement.

From "Zivotofsky v. Clinton" ==> """
Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189 (2012), is a Supreme Court of the United States decision in which the Court held that a dispute over the regulation of passports was not a political question and thus resolvable by the courts. Specifically, Zivotofsky's parents sought to have his passport read "Jerusalem, Israel", rather than "Jerusalem", as his place of birth. The State Department had rejected that request under a longstanding policy that took no stance on the legal status of Jerusalem. The Court said that Zivotofsky could test the constitutionality of a Congressional law that ordered the Secretary of State to list people born in Jerusalem as born in Israel. This action was taken over the objections of the State Department, which insisted that issues of foreign policy were inherently political and thus not justiciable by the Courts.  On remand, the Court of Appeals held in July 2013 that the law was an unconstitutional infringement of the President's recognition powers.United States Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia Circuit No. 07-5347, Zivotofsky v. Secretary of State, 
http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/C8DC59BCC7D10E6D85257BB10051786D/$file/07-5347-1447974.pdf
On April 21, 2014, the Supreme Court granted the Zivotofskys' petition for certiorari, in Zivotofsky v. Kerry.  In 2015, the Court held that the President of the United States has an exclusive power of recognition, and, therefore, Congress may not require the State Department to regard Jerusalem as part of Israel.
 Background 
 Passport policy changes 
In early 2002, Congress passed a passport regulation as part of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, the annual budget authorization bill for the State Department. The policy (entitled "Record of Place of Birth as Israel for Passport Purposes") stated that "[f]or purposes of the registration of birth, certification of nationality, or issuance of a passport of a United States citizen born in the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the request of the citizen or the citizen's legal guardian, record the place of birth as Israel."Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, 116 Stat. 1350, Section 214 This Congress-passed policy directly contradicted the State Department's guidelines which ordered the naming of the city alone when a nation's borders were in dispute.7 Foreign Affairs Manual § 1383.5-2, App. 108 This policy had been applied to citizens born in Jerusalem.§ 1383, Exh. 1383.1, App. 127
When the act was passed in 2002, Hillary Clinton was a member of the Senate.  The act passed by unanimous consent.  Clinton was later appointed Secretary of State and sued in her official capacity over the State Department's refusal to issue a passport in compliance with the act.
When the bill was presented to the President, George W. Bush attached a signing statement to  the bill, expressing his belief that the Jerusalem policy passed by Congress would "interfere with the President's constitutional authority to... determine the terms on which recognition is given to foreign states."Statement on Signing the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, Public Papers of the Presidents, George W. Bush, Vol. 2, Sept. 30, 2002, p. 1698 (2005)
 Zivotofsky's suit 
Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem on October 17, 2002, after the enactment of the Congress-passed Jerusalem policy. After their request to the State Department for his passport place-of-birth to say "Israel" was denied, his parents filed suit.Lawfare, Supreme Court Holds No Political Question in Zivotofsky, Remands for Decision on the Merits, March 26, 2012. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the case on the grounds that the case brought a nonjusticiable political question. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, holding that the question in the lawsuit had changed to the validity of the Congressional policy, Section 214 of the 2002 Act.444 F.3d 614, 619 (2006)
On remand, the District Court again found the case barred as being a political question; the Court said that Zivotofsky's claim would "necessarily require the Court to decide the political status of Jerusalem."511 F.Supp.2d 97, 103 (2007) On this question, the D.C. Circuit Court affirmed, holding that taking any position "on the status of Jerusalem" was not appropriate for judicial review.
Zivotofsky's parents petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to hear the case. The case was subsequently granted.563 U.S. ____, 131 S.Ct. 2897, 179 L.Ed.2d 1187 (2011)
 Opinion of the Court 
Chief Justice John G. Roberts wrote the majority opinion for the Court, reversing the D.C. Circuit, and holding that Zivotofsky's claim could be reviewed by the courts. "In this case," Roberts wrote, "determining the constitutionality of § 214(d) involves deciding whether the statute impermissibly intrudes upon Presidential powers under the Constitution." Judging the constitutionality of a law in this context would not "turn on standards that defy judicial application" because reviewing the "textual, structural, and historical evidence put forward by the parties" is "what courts do." For this reason, even though such a decision may touch on political areas, there would be no reason the courts couldn't work through the evidence for an answer. To begin that task, the Court remanded the case back to the lower courts to conduct this analysis.
Sotomayor's concurrence
Justice Sonia Sotomayor concurred in part in the Court's opinion and concurred in the judgment of the Court. She parted from the majority in the way she applied different factors to see whether the case was barred by the political question doctrine. Sotomayor argued that if "the parties' textual, structural, and historical evidence is inapposite or wholly unilluminating, rendering judicial decision no more than guesswork, a case relying on the ordinary kinds of arguments offered to courts might well still present justiciability concerns".
Alito's concurrence
Justice Samuel Alito wrote a concurring opinion, in which he agreed with the Court decision to reverse the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals but provided different grounds for doing so. He wrote that the issue before the Court was only a "narrow question" and thus it did not force the Court to enter a political realm.
Breyer's dissent
Justice Stephen Breyer dissented from the decision of the Court, arguing that the case was barred by the political question doctrine. Breyer argued that there were four sets of prudential considerations which, taken together in their totality, led to that conclusion. First, the issue arises in the field of foreign affairs. Second, the court may have to evaluate U.S. foreign policy. Third, no strong interest or right is at stake. Fourth, the conflict between Congress and the Executive can be resolved through nonjudicial means.

From "Zivotofsky v. Kerry" ==> """
Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. 1 (2015), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the President has the exclusive power to recognize (or not recognize) foreign nations, and, therefore, Congress may not require the State Department to indicate in passports that Jerusalem is part of Israel.
Background
Foreign Relations Authorization Act
On September 26, 2002, the U.S. Congress passed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. Section 214 of the Act, entitled "United States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel," included various statutes regarding the status of Jerusalem, including invoking the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 to urge the President to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, cutting budget authorizations for the publication of official documents "which lists countries and their capital cities unless the publication identifies Jerusalem as the capital of Israel," and authorizing American citizens born in Jerusalem to name "Israel" as their birthplace on official government documents. Specifically, section 214(d) states:
The section was seen by the Executive as conflicting with the long-standing U.S. policy that the status of Jerusalem must be resolved through negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.
President George W. Bush signed the act into law on September 30, but issued a signing statement asserting that "U.S. policy regarding Jerusalem has not changed" and section 214 "would, if construed as mandatory rather than advisory, impermissibly interfere with the President's constitutional authority to formulate the position of the United States, speak for the Nation in international affairs, and determine the terms on which recognition is given to foreign states."
Zivotofsky v. Clinton
Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem on October 17, 2002, shortly after the enactment of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. When both requests to list Israel as the birthplace on Menachem's passport were denied (first as "Jerusalem, Israel," then as simply "Israel"), parents Ari and Naomi Zivotofsky filed suit against the State Department (then headed by Hillary Clinton). The petitioners' case was ruled by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to be unqualified for judicial review as it seemingly posed a nonjusticiable "political question" and would "necessarily require the Court to decide the political status of Jerusalem."
On May 2, 2011, the Supreme Court granted the case (Zivotofsky v. Clinton) certiorari. It was argued on November 11 of that year, with attorney Nathan Lewin representing the petitioner and Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. representing the respondent. On March 26, 2012, the Court reversed the lower court decisions in an 8–1 decision (with Justices Alito and Sotomayor writing separate concurrences, and Justice Breyer writing the dissent). In writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts stated:
Opinion of the Court
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion for the Court, striking down the 2002 law and holding that the president has the exclusive power to recognize foreign nations, and that the power to determine what a passport says is part of this power. "Recognition is a matter on which the nation must speak with one voice. That voice is the president's."
Justice Stephen Breyer filed a short concurrence, reiterating his dissenting opinion from Zivotofsky v. Clinton. He wrote that the "case presents a political question inappropriate for judicial resolution."
Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. He backed the majority's view on the unconstitutionality of the section 214(d) passport provision but claimed such Presidential powers over passports do not extend to consular reports. He wrote the "regulation of these reports does not fall within the President's foreign affairs powers, but within Congress' enumerated powers under the Naturalization and Necessary and Proper Clauses."
Chief Justice John Roberts filed a dissenting opinion and was joined by Justice Samuel Alito. Roberts argued that the Constitution neither conclusively nor preclusively grants the President such power to recognize foreign nations.
Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion and was joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito. Scalia argued that the Constitution also grants Congress power to recognize foreign nations by way of the power to regulate commerce with foreign states. Furthermore, Scalia wrote that the 2002 law merely accommodates a "geographic description" similar to other descriptions that the State Department offers.

From "Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District" ==> """
Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District, 509 U.S. 1 (1993), was a case before the United States Supreme Court.
Background
A deaf child and his parents sued the Catalina Foothills Unified School District in Arizona because the district refused to provide a sign language interpreter for the child after he transferred from a public school to Salpointe Catholic High School, a parochial school. Plaintiffs challenged the refusal to provide an interpreter on a variety of constitutional and statutory grounds, including the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ("IDEA"), (1988). its Arizona counterpart,ARIZ. REV. STAT. ANN. §§ 15-761 to -772 (1991 & Supp. 1993). an IDEA regulation,34 C.F.R. § 76.532(a)(1) (1992). the Arizona Constitution,ARIZ. CONST. art. II, § 12. and the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Plaintiffs successfully sought relief from a federal district court, which concluded "The service at issue in this case is part of a general government program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as 'handicapped' under the IDEA, without regard to the 'sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature' of the school the child attends".
Opinion of the court
In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court reached the same issue, but reversed on the merits, finding that if it provided an interpreter the school district would not violate the Establishment Clause.Although the deaf child had completed his high school education by the time the Supreme Court faced this issue, the controversy was not moot because his parents sought reimbursement for the cost of hiring a private interpreter while the child attended parochial school. The Court held only that the Establishment Clause does not bar the school district from furnishing an interpreter in a parochial school. Lower federal courts will now have to determine whether the Zobrests are entitled to reimbursement for the interpreter's expenses.
In arguing its case before the lower courts, the school district raised other defenses in addition to the Establishment Clause bar. The district argued that the provision of an interpreter violated the Arizona Constitution, was not required by federal statute (IDEA) or regulation, and was, in fact, precluded under a federal funding regulation promulgated under the IDEA. The Court declined to address these "unrelated" issues because the parties pressed only the federal constitutional issue at both the appellate level and the summary judgment stage of the district court proceedings. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice Rehnquist, recognized the validity of the "prudential rule of avoiding constitutional questions"; however, it acknowledged that the Court, on appeal, is presented with the "entire case," including "'nonconstitutional questions actually decided by the lower court as well as nonconstitutional grounds presented to, but not passed on, by the lower court.'".
In the Zobrest litigation, however, the Court found it significant that only the First Amendment questions—rather than nonconstitutional grounds—were "pressed" before the Ninth Circuit and that, even before the district court, "the parties chose to litigate the case on the federal constitutional issues alone."Zobrest, 509 U.S. at 7-8. The Court concluded: "Given this posture of the case, we think the prudential rule of avoiding constitutional questions has no application. The fact that there may be buried in the record a nonconstitutional ground for decision is not by itself enough to invoke this rule."Zobrest, 509 U.S. at 8. The Court then proceeded directly to the First Amendment issue, without considering any other grounds for the decision.
Dissent
The four dissenters—Justices Blackmun, O'Connor, Souter and Stevens—accused the Zobrest majority of "unnecessarily address[ing] an important constitutional issue, [and] disregarding longstanding principles of constitutional adjudication."Zobrest, 509 U.S. at 14 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). The dissent argued that resolution of the constitutional issue was not necessary because the Court could have remanded the case for consideration of alternative grounds of resolution. The lower courts then could have construed the IDEA so as not to require an interpreter for a parochial student so long as the school district provided an interpreter in a public school which the child could attend. The majority, however, merely held that governmental provision of an interpreter did not establish religion and that the Establishment Clause did not bar provision of an interpreter. In further proceedings, the lower courts may determine—despite the Supreme Court's Establishment Clause ruling—that the IDEA does not require provision of an interpreter in a parochial school when one is available in a public school in the district.
The parties deliberately did not brief or argue the "weighty" nonconstitutional issues because, according to the dissent, they wanted a ruling on the Establishment Clause question. The dissenters would have heeded the avoidance doctrine by vacating and remanding the case for consideration of the nonconstitutional questions, despite the parties' failure to brief these issues: "The obligation to avoid unnecessary adjudication of constitutional questions does not depend upon the parties' litigation strategy, but rather is a 'self-imposed limitation on the exercise of this Court's jurisdiction [that] has an importance to the institution that transcends the significance of particular controversies.'"Zobrest, 509 U.S. at 16 (Blackmun, J., dissenting, quoting ).  The dissent asserted that the avoidance doctrine is the most "deeply rooted" doctrine of constitutional adjudication. The doctrine amounts to a "fundamental rule of judicial restraint," which has received the sanction of time and experience.Zobrest, 509 U.S. at 14 (Blackmun, J., dissenting, quoting ).  The dissent imbued the avoidance doctrine with constitutional weight by relying on earlier Supreme Court precedent relating the avoidance doctrine to the case or controversy requirement. The dissenters also likened it to the "policy against entertaining political questions." Despite those constitutional linkages, however, the avoidance doctrine is most commonly classified as a prudential rule of judicial self-restraint.

From "Zorach v. Clauson" ==> """
Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (1952), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States allowed a school district to allow students to leave school for part of the day to receive religious instruction..
Case
New York State law permitted schools to allow some students to leave school during school hours for purposes of religious instruction or practice while requiring others to stay in school. Accordingly, students in New York City were allowed to leave only on written request of their guardians but the schools did not fund or otherwise assist in the development of these programs. The Greater New York Coordinating Committee on Released Time of Jews, Protestants and Roman Catholics shared their attendance with New York City Department of Education to prevent students from truancy, however. Several parents sued the district for providing official sanction for religious instruction.
Decision
The Supreme Court upheld the arrangement by finding that it did not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the instruction was not held within the school building and received no public funds.  William O. Douglas, writing for the majority, reasoned that "this 'released time' program involves neither religious instruction in public school classrooms nor the expenditure of public funds.... The case is therefore unlike McCollum v. Board of Education."
Three Justices dissented from the decision; Hugo Black, Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson considered the law unconstitutional. All three cited McCollum v. Board of Education (1948). and believed that the Court did not adequately distinguish between the circumstances in McCollum and the ones in Zorach. Jackson's dissent was especially strong: "Today's judgment will be more interesting to students of psychology and of the judicial processes than to students of constitutional law."

From "Zschernig v. Miller" ==> """
Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U.S. 429 (1968), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States invalidated an Oregon statute for unconstitutionally intruding into the federal realm of foreign affairs even though the statute did not conflict with any federal treaty or statute.. 10 U.S. Op. Off. Legal Counsel 49, 61-62 (1986)
 Introduction 
An Oregon resident died and their only heirs were residents of East Germany.  When the heirs tried to claim their inheritance, the Stand Land Board attempted to escheat the funds because East Germany would not allow the inheritance if the countries involved were reversed.
 Facts of the case 
The Oregon law at issue in the case provided that a nonresident alien could not inherit property from an Oregon decedent unless: 1) the alien's government granted Americans the right to inherit on the same terms as its own citizens, 2) the alien's government gave Americans the right to receive payment in the U.S. from foreign funds, and 3) the alien was able to receive "the benefit, use or control" of the Oregon bequest "without confiscation" by the alien's government.
 Decision 
The court found the law unconstitutional because of "intrusion by the State into the field of foreign affairs which the Constitution entrusts to the President and the Congress."Zschernig, 389 U.S. at 432. The Supreme Court applied Zschernig in American Insurance Association v. Garamendi, a 2003 case, although they relied more on Justice Harlan's concurring opinion in Zschernig than on the majority's reasoning.

From "Zubik v. Burwell" ==> """
Zubik v. Burwell, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a case before the United States Supreme Court on whether religious institutions other than churches should be exempt from the contraceptive mandate, a regulation adopted by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that requires non-church employers to cover certain contraceptives for their female employees. Churches are already exempt under those regulations.Justices Seem Split in Case on Birth Control Mandate, Adam Liptak, New York Times, March 23, 2016 On May 16, 2016, the Supreme Court vacated the Court of Appeals ruling in Zubik v. Burwell and the six cases it had consolidated under that title and returned them to their respective courts of appeals for reconsideration.
Background
Federal law
thumb|300px|EBSA Form 700, version as of January 1, 2014
Religious Freedom Restoration Act
The United States Supreme Court ruled in Employment Division v. Smith (1990) that a person may not defy "neutral laws of general applicability" even as an expression of religious belief. "To permit this," wrote Justice Scalia, citing the 1878 Reynolds v. United States decision, "would make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.". He wrote that generally applicable laws do not have to meet the standard of strict scrutiny, because such a requirement would create "a private right to ignore generally applicable laws". Strict scrutiny would require a law to be the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.
In 1993, the U.S. Congress responded by passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), requiring strict scrutiny when a neutral law of general applicability "substantially burden[s] a person's exercise of religion". The RFRA was amended in 2000 by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) to redefine exercise of religion as any exercise of religion, "whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief", which is to be "construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the Constitution". The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the RFRA as applied to federal statutes in Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita in 2006.
Affordable Care Act
Most Americans are covered by employer-sponsored health insurance. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which relies on the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to specify what kinds of preventive care for women should be covered in certain employer-based health plans. The HRSA decided that all twenty contraceptives approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be covered. Employers that refuse are fined $100 per individual per day, or they can replace their health coverage with higher wages and a calibrated tax.
HHS exempted churches (including houses of worship, such as synagogues and mosques) and their integrated auxiliaries, associations of churches, and any religious order that engages exclusively in religious activity. These are the same groups exempt from filing IRS Form 990. Employers providing grandfathered plans (plans that have not had specific changes before March 23, 2010), and employers with fewer than 50 employees were also exempt. Other non-profit organizations that object to any required contraception coverage could file an EBSA form 700 with their insurance company notifying them of the non-profit's objection. The insurance company would then provide the contraceptive coverage directly to employees without any involvement of the employer, including any distribution of literature or extra payments by the employer.
Initial litigation
The Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic religious order, runs over 25 homes for low-income elderly in the United StatesLittle Sister Directory of Homes accessed March 27, 2016 and therefore is not automatically exempt from the contraceptive mandate. It objected to filing Form 700 because it believed that doing would make the order complicit in providing contraception, a sin under Catholic doctrine. On December 31, 2013, the day before the filing requirement was to come into effect, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted a temporary injunction to the Little Sisters of the Poor, allowing them to simply inform the Secretary of Health and Human Services of their objections, pending resolution of the case. Other religious institutions filed similar objections.
On February 15, 2012, Priests for Life v. HHS  was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York challenging the constitutionality of the contraceptive mandate on behalf of Priests for Life, a national, Catholic, pro-life organization based in New York City. The case was dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge Frederic Block for lack of ripeness because the new compromise regulations were not yet finalized.
On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. that under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), closely held for-profit corporations are exempt from the contraceptive mandate, if they object on religious grounds, because the accommodation offered to objecting non-profits would be a less restrictive way to achieve the ACA's interest..
On July 3, 2014, the Supreme Court granted a temporary exemption to the approach it suggested as a less restrictive alternative in Hobby Lobby, where the plaintiffs would send an EBSA Form 700 to its insurance issuer, which would pay for the contraception. In an unsigned emergency injunction for Wheaton College in Illinois, the court said that instead of notifying its insurance issuer, Wheaton can notify the government. Once notified, the government should notify the issuer. Wheaton believed that by transferring the obligation to cover contraceptives to its insurance issuer, it was triggering that obligation. The emergency injunction does not constitute a ruling on the merits of Wheaton's religious objection. The court said "Nothing in this interim order affects the ability of the applicant's employees and students to obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives."Order in Pending Case, Wheaton College v. Bruwell, On Application for Injunction, July 3, 2014 In a 15-page dissent, joined by the other two female jurists on the court, Justice Sotomayor criticized the majority's reasoning and distinguished it from the situation with the Little Sisters of the Poor. A revised version of EBSA Form 700, effective August 2014, says "[a]s an alternative to using this form, an eligible organization may provide notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the eligible organization has a religious objection to providing coverage for all or a subset of contraceptive services..."
Eight appeals courts upheld the ACA mandate for non-church religious institutions. Only the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the other way, upholding the challenge by religious non-profit institutions in September 2015 in two cases, Sharpe Holdings v. HHS and Dordt College v. Burwell.
Litigation in the U.S. Supreme Court
On November 6, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court consolidated seven cases, all challenges to the contraceptive mandate. The case is titled Zubik v. Burwell and the cases consolidated under that title and the Court of Appeals that issued the decision being appealed were:
 Zubik v. Burwell (Third Circuit Court of Appeals)
 Geneva College v. Burwell (Third Circuit Court of Appeals)
 East Texas Baptist University v. Burwell (Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals)
 Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell (Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals)
 Southern Nazarene University v. Burwell (Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals)
 Priests for Life v. Burwell (District of Columbia Circuit)
 Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington v. Burwell (District of Columbia Circuit)
Oral arguments
Oral arguments were heard on March 23, 2016. Issues discussed included how and where to draw the line between exempt churches and other religious non-profits and whether the government was "hijacking" the insurance plans created by the non-profits to achieve the government's goals. Because of Justice Antonin Scalia's death in February, only eight justices heard the arguments, raising the possibility of an equally divided court, which would leave the appeals court rulings in force in their respective jurisdictions.
Supplemental briefing
On March 29 the Court directed the parties "to file supplemental briefs that address whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners' employees through petitioners's insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to their employees." The Court suggested a possible scheme where petitioners would obtain insurance without contraceptive coverage and "petitioners' insurance company, aware that petitioners are not providing certain contraceptive coverage on religious grounds, would separately notify petitioners' employees that the insurance company will provide cost-free contraceptive coverage, and that such coverage is not paid for by petitioners and is not provided through petitioners's health plan." Also, of particular interest to the court was the question raised in an amicus brief of conscientious objection suggesting that courts may not usurp the right of religious adherents to determine their own views regarding moral complicity.
Ruling
On May 16, 2016, the Court issued a per curiam decision that vacated the decisions of the Circuit Courts of Appeals and remanded the cases to those courts for reconsideration in light of the "positions asserted by the parties in their supplemental briefs".Zubik v. Burwell, No. 14–1418, 578 U.S. ___, slip op. at 3, 5 (2016) (per curiam). Because the Petitioners agreed that "their religious exercise is not infringed where they 'need to do nothing more than contract for a plan that does not include coverage for some or all forms of contraception'", the Court held that the parties should be given an opportunity to clarify and refine how this approach would work in practice and to "resolve any outstanding issues".Zubik, slip op. at 3-4. In a departure from the usual treatment of per curiam rulings, Chief Justice Roberts read the ruling aloud in court. The Supreme Court expressed "no view on the merits of the cases."Zubik, slip op. at 4. In a concurring opinion, Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ginsburg, noted that in earlier cases "some lower courts have ignored those instructions" and cautioned lower courts not to read any signals in the Supreme Court's actions in this case. She cited as an example the Eighth Circuit opinion in Sharpe Holdings, the only Court of Appeals decision that had upheld the position taken by the Zubik plaintiffs.Zubik, slip op. at 2-3 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).
Further litigation
On May 23 the Supreme Court returned two additional cases back to their respective Courts of Appeals for reconsideration in light of the filings in Zubik: Catholic Healthcare System v. Burwell (Second Circuit Court of Appeals) and Michigan Catholic Conference v. Burwell (Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals).
On July 21 the Obama administration asked the Courts of Appeals considering the Zubik cases to allow 65 days for the government to seek advice from third parties on all aspects of the legal dispute, from technical and practical implementation issues to religious and legal insight. It published a general appeal for comment and advice from "all interested stakeholders" in the Federal Register the next day.
When Donald Trump took over as President in 2017, one of the first Executive Orders he enacted was to order the HHS to issue a ruling to allow for conscientious objections to the mandate, which was published in late 2017 and allowed for for-profit religious organizations to claim exemption from the mandate on religious or moral grounds. This led to numerous states pursuing further legal action on the new rules that culminated in another Supreme Court case, Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, which was heard in May 2020. The Supreme Court upheld the rules on a 7–2 decision issued in July 2020.

From "Zucht v. King" ==> """
Zucht v. King, 260 U.S. 174 (1922),. was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held, 9–0, that public schools could constitutionally exclude unvaccinated students from attending, even if there was not an ongoing outbreak. In the case, the school district of San Antonio, Texas enacted an ordinance that prohibited any child from attending a school within the district unless they had been vaccinated against smallpox. One parent of a student who had been excluded, Rosalyn Zucht, sued on the basis that there was not a public health emergency.Zucht v. King, 260 U.S. at 175. Justice Louis Brandeis wrote for the unanimous court that requiring students to be vaccinated was a justified use of "police power" to maintain public health and safety.
Brandeis invoked a previous decision, Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905), in which the Court upheld the authority of the states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws.
Opinion
The city of San Antonio, Texas, enacted an ordinance prohibiting any child from attending a public school or other places of education without having first presented a certificate of vaccination for smallpox. Consequently, Rosalyn Zucht was excluded from both public and private schools due to her refusal to receive a vaccination. Zucht sued, asserting that there was no emergency requiring vaccination and that she was deprived of liberty without due process of law by effectively making vaccination compulsory. The Texas state courts denied her claims, and she appealed to the United States Supreme Court.
In a brief opinion, the Court noted that in the previous case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts, the Court "had settled that it is within the police power of a state to provide for compulsory vaccination". The Court found no reason to question the fairness with which the city ordinance was applied in this case, and found that the ordinance reflected the broad discretion needed by authorities to protect the public health. The Court also noted that although the plaintiff asserted an equal protection violation, she had not articulated any impermissible discrimination that would invoke that doctrine, leaving nothing for the Court to examine with respect to such a claim.

From "Zurcher v. Stanford Daily" ==> """
Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U.S. 547 (1978), is a United States Supreme Court case from 1978 in which The Stanford Daily, a student newspaper at Stanford University, was searched by police after they suspected the paper to be in possession of photographs of a demonstration that took place at the university's hospital in April 1971. The Stanford Daily filed a suit claiming that under the protection of the First and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution, the warrants were unconstitutional and that the searches should have fallen under the context of subpoenas. The Supreme Court ruled against The Stanford Daily;. however, Congress later passed the Privacy Protection Act of 1980, which provides additional protections against searches and seizures to the press and individuals who disseminate information to the public, unless that individual is suspected of a crime or a life-threatening situation is present.The Privacy Protection Act of 1980, http://epic.org/privacy/ppa
 Background & Facts 
On April 9, 1971, thirteen police officers were injured by a group of demonstrators when the police entered Stanford University Hospital to break up a 30-hour sit-in led by the Black United Front.Kohn, Ed, Police Break Up Hospital Sit-In, The Stanford Daily, Volume 159 (April 11, 1971).Lyman, Richard W., Stanford in Turmoil: Campus Unrest, 1966-1972, Stanford University Press, 186 (2009). The Black United Front was protesting the firing of a black janitor at the hospital.Knowles, Hannah, Sit-Ins Have a Long History in Stanford Protests, The Stanford Daily (November 18, 2015). A Stanford Daily staff photographer had been positioned in the part of the hospital where the police officers were injured, and following the violent encounter, the Santa Clara District Attorney's office secured a warrant for the search of The Stanford Daily's offices for photographs taken by that photographer.Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 551. Following these events, The Stanford Daily brought this civil action against the police officers and chief of police who conducted the search of The Stanford Daily offices, the district attorney, and the judge that had issued the search warrant.Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 552. The Stanford Daily brought the case under : Civil action for deprivation of rights.
The United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted declaratory relief to The Stanford Daily and held that a warrant for the search of a third party not suspected of criminal activity (a "nonsuspect third party") is forbidden by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments unless there is probable cause to find a subpoena duces tecum to be impracticable. The court did not believe requiring police forces to obtain information from third parties using the subpoena process, rather than the warrant process, would be detrimental to criminal investigations because innocent third parties in possession of evidence are not incentivized to tamper with or hide evidence.Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 561. Therefore, the District Court did not believe that a warrant was necessary to preserve the effectiveness of criminal investigations when they are issued to obtain evidence from nonsuspect third parties.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed and adopted the District Court's ruling.Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 553.
 Legal Issues 
 Fourth Amendment 
The main question posed in this case was how the Fourth Amendment should be applied to searches of third parties, where "state authorities have probable cause to believe that fruits, instrumentalities, or other evidence of crime is located on identified property but do not have probable cause to believe that the owner or possessor of that property is himself implicated in the crime" that is being investigated.
 First Amendment 
There was also a First Amendment question at issue in this case. The Stanford Daily asserted that their First Amendment rights were violated by the search and seizure of photographs from their offices. They argued that the issuance of warrants for the search of press facilities chills speech because searches physically disrupt newspaper publication operations, and would cause confidential sources of information to fear providing such information to the press in the future given the possibility that their confidentiality could be destroyed by an unannounced search conducted by state authorities.Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 563-64. Therefore, the Court also answered the question of whether and how search warrants can be applied to the press and in situations where the materials being seized might be protected by the First Amendment.
 Decision & Opinion 
Justice White delivered the court's 5–3 opinion in favor of Zurcher. The Court held that a state is not prohibited from issuing a warrant to search and seize evidence from a third party who is not a criminal suspect. Additionally, the Court held that conditions for a search warrant "must be applied with particular exactitude" when First Amendment considerations are at play.
The Court reasoned that the critical element in determining whether a search of an owner's property is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment is not whether the owner is criminally liable, but rather, whether there is reason to believe that there is evidence located on the owner's property.Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 556. The opinion stated that the Fourth Amendment itself serves the purpose of balancing a citizen's right to privacy and the public interest in effective criminal investigations, and it is not the Court's place to dictate this balance.Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 559.
The Court also disagreed with the District Court's assessment of the effectiveness of a subpoena duces tecum in searches of nonsuspect third parties. Even if a third party is "seemingly blameless," they may still be found criminally liable later in the investigation or might know the criminal and thus have reason to tamper with and destroy evidence. Further, the Court mentioned the possibility that an innocent third party in possession of critical criminal evidence might accidentally discard or destroy evidence in the long period of time that it takes for a subpoena to be processed. For these reasons, the quicker warrant process preserves and protects critical criminal evidence in a way that subpoenas cannot. The majority also disagreed with the argument that privacy interests are minimized with this decision because warrants are more restrictive and require a judiciary to rule on the reasonableness of the warrant. On the other hand, subpoenas do not require judicial scrutiny or proof of probable cause.Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 562-63.
Finally, in response to the First Amendment arguments raised by The Stanford Daily, the majority cited Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476 (1965) which held that where evidence seized may be protected by the First Amendment, warrant requirements should be assessed with "scrupulous exactitude."Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 564. The majority was also careful to note that while "scrupulous exactitude" is required in these instances, there is no constitutional basis for forbidding warrants where the First Amendment is implicated altogether.Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 565.
 Concurrence 
Justice Powell wrote a concurrence in the case solely to take issue with Justice Stewart's dissenting opinion. Justice Powell stated that the Framers of the Constitution did not carve out special Fourth Amendment protections for the press and that there was no constitutional authority to exempt the press from search warrants.Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 569-70.
 Dissenting Opinions 
The dissenting opinion authored by Justices Stewart and Marshall focused on the burden the Court's ruling imposed on freedom of the press and conveyed the belief that a subpoena would be just as effective as a warrant in criminal investigations requiring information from nonsuspect third parties.Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 575. The Justices expressed concern that "the possibility of disclosure of information received from confidential sources, or the identity of the sources [caused by an unannounced police search of a newspaper office]" would chill speech and diminish the flow of useful information to the public.Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 571-73. They did not believe that this concern was addressed adequately by the majority opinion.
In his dissent, Justice Stevens expressed concern about the implications of subjecting "countless law-abiding citizens—doctors, lawyers, merchants, customers, bystanders—[who] may have documents in their possession that relate to an ongoing criminal investigation" to unannounced searches and seizures.Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 579. Similar to Justices Stewart and Marshall, Justice Stevens also expressed his belief that a subpoena would have been effective in this situation.Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 581. He wrote that "the only conceivable justification for an unannounced search of an innocent citizen is the fear that, if notice were given, he would conceal or destroy the object of the search."Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 582.
 Implications 
Congress reacted to the Supreme Court's opinion in Zurcher v. Stanford Daily by passing the Privacy Protection Act of 1980.Hearing on S. 115, S. 1790, and S. 1816 Before the Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate, 96th Congress, 2nd Session, Serial No. 96-59 (March 28, 1980).Privacy Protection Act of 1980: Report together with Additional Views of the Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate on S. 1790, 96th Congress, 2nd Session, S. Rep. No. 96-874 (July 28, 1989). Following the Court's decision in this case, President Carter asked the Justice Department and Congress to consider the viability of a legislative solution to address the issues raised in this case.Elizabeth B. Uzelac, Reviving the Privacy Protection Act of 1980, 107 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1437, 1443 (2013). Just under a month after the Supreme Court issued its opinion, the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution commenced hearings to discuss the implications of the Court's decision.126 Cong. Rec. at 21273, 96th Congress, 2nd Session (August 4, 1980).
In a Message from the President of the United States to the 96th Congress on April 2, 1979, President Carter wrote about what he believed to be the dangers to the "effective functioning of our free press" raised by the Supreme Court's decision in Zurcher v. Stanford Daily.Message from the President of the United States, 96th Congress, 1st Session, H.R. Doc. No. 96-84 (April 2, 1979). President Carter went on to say that the issues raised in Zurcher v. Stanford Daily "require new, stringent safeguards against Federal, state and local governmental intrusion into First Amendment activities."
The final legislation, The Privacy Protection Act of 1980, supplemented the Fourth Amendment and enhanced privacy protections but was limited in its applicability to individuals engaged in disseminating information to the public, as opposed to being made applicable to the broader group of nonsuspect third parties. Nevertheless, questions still remain as to how broadly a "person in connection with a purpose to disseminate to the public" should be construed, especially in today's digital world where individuals have an open access public digital platform to disseminate information.42 U.S.C. §2000aa(b).
Litigation on issues similar to those raised in Zurcher v. Stanford Daily have been decided in the wake of the enactment of the Privacy Act of 1980. A few notable decisions interpreting the Act include:
 Citicasters v. McCaskill, 89 F.3d 1350 (8th Cir. 1996): Interpreted the warrant procedure requirements under the Act.
 Guest v. Leis, 255 F.3d 325 (6th Cir. 2001): Interpreted the class of individuals and parties to be protected by the Act.
 Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. U.S. Secret Serv. 816 F. Supp. 432, 440 (W.D. Tex. 1993), aff'd, 36 F.3d 457 (5th Cir. 1994): Interpreted what types of materials are protected by the Act.
While litigation in this area is significantly impacted by the passage of the Privacy Protection Act of 1980, Zurcher v. Stanford Daily is still cited in court opinions following the passage of the Act. For example, in Wyoming v. Houghton, the Supreme Court cited Zurcher v. Stanford Daily to set out the elements for a reasonable search.. In 2017, the Sixth Circuit cited Zurcher v. Stanford Daily in United States v. Talley, repeating that the “critical element in a reasonable search is ... that there is reasonable cause to believe that the specific ‘things' to be searched for and seized are located on the property to which entry is sought.”United States v. Talley, 692 F. App'x 219, 221 (6th Cir. 2017) (citing Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 556).
