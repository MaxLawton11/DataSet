# Wikipedia-Scraping-From-CSV

This program creates a large text file from Wikipedia articles. You can see a basic example of this by looking at the default contents of the `output.text` file. The file is cleared everytime the program is run. To run, add the names of the articles you want into the `wikipedia_sheet.csv` file, and run `./buildData.sh` or `python3 main.py`. (Note: You do not need to add commas after the names of your articles, but the csv file must start with "===," in order for proper formatting)
