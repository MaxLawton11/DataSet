From "Taylor v. Louisiana" ==> """
Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522 (1975), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court which held that women could not be excluded from a venire, or jury pool, on the basis of having to register for jury duty.. The court overturned Hoyt v. Florida,. the 1961 case that had allowed such a practice.
Background
Billy J. Taylor was indicted and tried for "aggravated kidnapping" under Louisiana's then-mandatory capital sentencing system. While armed with a butcher knife, he approached an automobile occupied by Mrs. Louise Willie, her daughter, and grandson, forced her to go to an abandoned road near Mandeville, where he raped her before robbing them.Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. at 524.  Both parties agreed:
Issues
The issue before the court was not whether Taylor actually kidnapped anyone, but whether he had a fair trial because Louisiana law had a "conceded systematic impact" to eliminate female jurors from his jury:Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. at 525-26.
A secondary issue was whether Taylor had standing, as a man who would not be excluded from jury duty in Louisiana, to challenge the rule.Pursuant to , see Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. at 525-26, 528, FN 12.
Decision
The Supreme Court "changed its mind and ruled the affirmative registration process was unconstitutional:"Dean John Champion, Richard D. Hartley, and Gary A. Rabe, "Criminal Courts," p. 219 (2nd ed., Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson 2008),  citing  and .
On the secondary issue of standing, it held:
Reasoning
The Courts' reasoning was based heavily on the precedent from prior case law: "The Court's prior cases are instructive":Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. at 526.
Duncan v. LouisianaDuncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, at 155-156, 88 S. Ct. 1444 at 1450-1451, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491, 1968 U.S. LEXIS 1631 (1968). appears to have been especially important to the court for use as a precedent. It was a significant United States Supreme Court decision, which incorporated the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial and applied it to the states.
Ballard v. United States (1946), another precedent, concerned the exclusion of "an economic or racial group".Ballard v. United States, . Ultimately, the line of cases come from Glasser v. United States (1942),Glasser v. United States, . Smith v. Texas (1940),Smith v. Texas, . Pierre v. Louisiana (1939),Pierre v. Louisiana, . and Strauder v. State of West Virginia (1880),Strauder v. State of West Virginia, . all of which concerned the exclusion of blacks from juries as unconstitutional violations of the Equal Protection Clause.

From "Taylor v. Standard Gas & Electric Co." ==> """
Taylor v. Standard Gas and Electric Company, 306 U.S. 307 (1939), was an important United States Supreme Court case in United States corporate law that laid down the "Deep Rock doctrine" as a rule of bankruptcy and corporate law. This holds that claims, as creditors, upon an insolvent subsidiary company by controlling shareholders or other insiders, like managers or directors, will be subordinated to the claims of all other creditors.
Facts
The Deep Rock Oil Corporation was an undercapitalized subsidiary of the defendant Standard Gas Company.
Judgment
The Supreme Court held that, where a subsidiary corporation declares bankruptcy and an insider or controlling shareholder of that subsidiary corporation asserts claims as a creditor against the subsidiary, loans made by the insider to the subsidiary corporation may be deemed to receive the same treatment as shares of stock owned by the insider. 
Therefore, the insider's claims will be subordinated to the claims of all other creditors, i.e. other creditors will be paid first, and if there is nothing left after other creditors are paid then the insider gets nothing. This also applies (and indeed the doctrine was first established) where a parent company asserts such claims against its own subsidiary.
The doctrine will be applied where equity requires, particularly where the subsidiary was undercapitalized at the time that it was established, and can thereby be shown to have been mismanaged for the parent corporation's benefit.

Taylor v. Mississippi, 319 U.S. 583 (1943), was a case involving three Jehovah's Witnesses in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that criminal sanction cannot be imposed for communication that has not been shown to have been done with an evil or sinister purpose, to have advocated or incited subversive action against the nation or state, or to have threatened any clear and present danger to our institutions or our government.. 
 Facts of the case 
March 20, 1942, the State of Mississippi enacted a statute the title of which declares that it is intended to secure the peace and safety of the United States and of the State of Mississippi during war and to prohibit acts detrimental to public peace and safety. The first section, with which alone we are here concerned, provides: 
That any person who individually, or as a member of any organization, association, or otherwise, shall intentionally preach, teach, or disseminate any teachings, creed, theory, or set of alleged principles, orally, or by means of a phonograph or other contrivance of any kind or nature, or by any other means or method, or by the distribution of any sort of literature, or written or printed matter, designed and calculated to encourage violence, sabotage, or disloyalty to the government of the United States, or the state of Mississippi, or who by action or speech, advocates the cause of the enemies of the United States or who gives information as to the military operations, or plans of defense or military secrets of the nation or this state, by speech, letter, map or picture which would incite any sort of racial distrust, disorder, prejudices or hatreds, or which reasonably tends to create an attitude of stubborn refusal to salute, honor or respect the flag or government of the United States, or of the state of Mississippi, shall be guilty of a felony and punished by imprisonment in the state penitentiary until treaty of peace be declared by the United States but such imprisonment shall not exceed ten years.Taylor, 319 U.S. at 584.
Taylor was indicted for orally disseminating teachings designed and calculated to encourage disloyalty to the government of the United States and that of the State of Mississippi; and for orally disseminating teachings and distributing literature and printed matter reasonably tending to create an attitude of stubborn refusal to salute, honor, and respect the flag and government of the United States and of the State of [319 U.S. 583, 585]   Mississippi, and designed and calculated to encourage disloyalty to the government of the United States. 
Betty Benoit was indicted for disseminating and distributing literature and printed matter designed and calculated, and which reasonably tended to create an attitude of stubborn refusal to salute, honor, and respect the flag and government of the United States. 
Cummings was indicted for distributing printed matter designed and calculated to encourage disloyalty to the United States government and to the State of Mississippi, and tending to create an attitude of stubborn refusal to salute, honor or respect the flag or the government of the United States and the State of Mississippi.
Decision of the Court
Justice Roberts delivered the decision of the Court, reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi. 
The statute as construed in these cases makes it a criminal offense to communicate to others views and opinions respecting governmental policies, and prophesies concerning the future of our own and other nations. As applied to the appellants it punishes them although what they communicated is not claimed or shown to have been done with an evil or sinister purpose, to have advocated or incited subversive action against the nation or state, or to have threatened any clear and present danger to our institutions or our government. What these appellants communicated were their beliefs and opinions concerning domestic measures and trends in national and world affairs. 
Under our decisions criminal sanctions cannot be imposed for such communication.Taylor, 319 U.S. at 589-90.

From "Taylor v. Taintor" ==> """
Taylor v. Taintor, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 366 (1872), was a United States Supreme Court case. It is commonly credited as having decided that a person to whom a suspect is remanded, such as a bail bondsman, has sweeping rights to recover the suspect. 
Case overview
In 1866, sureties made an $8,000 cash bond for Edward McGuire in Connecticut, after he was charged with grand larceny. While awaiting trial in Connecticut, McGuire returned to his home in New York. Unknown to the bondsmen in Connecticut, McGuire was wanted in Maine for another felony. Upon request from the Governor of Maine later in 1866, the Governor of New York extradited McGuire to Maine, where he was convicted of burglary in 1867 and imprisoned for fifteen years. When McGuire failed to appear for trial in Connecticut in October 1866, the cash bond was forfeited. The Connecticut bondsmen sought relief from the forfeiture on grounds that they were not at fault in failing to secure McGuire's appearance, but rather that his nonappearance was the result of his extradition to Maine—an intervening "act of law" under the Extradition Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  The Supreme Court, by a vote of 4 to 3 (two justices recused themselves) held that the sureties were at fault and were not protected by the Extradition Clause. The sureties' "supineness and neglect" in failing to keep up with McGuire and to inform the New York authorities of the pending Connecticut case caused McGuire's nonappearance.Lund v. Seneca County Sheriff’s Department, 230 F.3d 196, 198 (6th Cir. 2000)

From "Taylor v. United States (1990)" ==> """
Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990), was a U.S. Supreme Court decision that filled in an important gap in the federal criminal law of sentencing. The federal criminal code does not contain a definition of many crimes, including burglary, the crime at issue in this case. Yet sentencing enhancements applicable to federal crimes allow for the enhancement of a defendant's sentence if he has been convicted of prior felonies. The Court addressed in this case how "burglary" should be defined for purposes of such sentencing enhancements when the federal criminal code contained no definition of "burglary."Taylor v. United States, . The approach the Court adopted in this case has guided the lower federal courts in interpreting other provisions of the criminal code that also refer to generic crimes not otherwise defined in federal law.
Facts
Taylor pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, in violation of (g). At the time, Taylor had four prior convictions—one for robbery, one for assault, and two were for second-degree burglary under Missouri law. The government sought the sentence enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act, codified in (e):
(1) In the case of a person who violates section 922(g)... and has three previous convictions by any court... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both... such person shall be fined not more than $25,000 and imprisoned not less than fifteen years.
(2) As used in this subsection —
(B) the term "violent felony" means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that —
(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or
(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
Taylor conceded that his prior assault and arson convictions qualified for the § 924(e) sentencing enhancement, but disputed that his two burglary convictions qualified for the enhancement, because they did not present a serious risk of physical injury to another. The district court rejected this argument, and sentenced Taylor to 15 years without parole.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the sentence. It ruled that "burglary" "means burglary however a state chooses to define it," the district court properly counted both of Taylor's Missouri burglary convictions under the § 924(e) sentence enhancement. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the case so that it could resolve a conflict among the federal courts of appeals about how "burglary" should be defined under § 924(e).
Opinion of the Court
The Court had to answer how to define "burglary" in § 924(e). It had no "single accepted meaning" in the laws of the states, and the text of the statute does not suggest a particular meaning. Should it therefore mean whatever the state of the defendant's prior conviction defines "burglary" to be? Should it instead have a more uniform definition? And if so, what should the source of that more uniform definition be?
The Court examined the progress of the bill that became § 924(e) as it wound its way through Congress. Throughout the legislative process, Congress consistently focused on "career offenders" — "those who commit a large number of fairly serious crimes as their means of livelihood and who, because they possess weapons, present at least a potential threat of harm to persons." Congress likewise singled out burglary because of the potential for harm that crime entails as compared to simple larceny or automobile crimes. Unlawful entry into a building always presents the danger of a confrontation, and if the intruder is likely to be armed, that confrontation becomes that much more dangerous. In earlier versions of the bill, Congress had specifically defined "burglary," thus suggesting that Congress had intended to take a "categorical approach" to defining burglary despite leaving the term undefined in the final version of the bill. Furthermore, the legislative history suggested that Congress intended that categorical approach to encompass a "generic" view of burglary, "roughly corresponding to the definitions of burglary in a majority of the States' criminal codes." In this way, Congress could avoid leaving the precise contours to the vagaries of varying definitions and labels crafted by other jurisdictions.
In light of these concerns, the Court rejected the Eighth Circuit's approach, which relegated the definition to state law. Because of differences in state laws, "a person imprudent enough to shoplift or steal from an automobile in California would be found, under the Ninth Circuit's view, to have committed a burglary constituting a "violent felony" for enhancement purposes — yet a person who did so in Michigan might not." Not seeing a clear indication that Congress intended for this to be the case, the Court reasoned that "odd results of this kind" should not result from interpreting § 924(e).
The Court next considered whether it should read the word "burglary" in § 924(e) as the common law did. This approach had some appeal; after all, all states' definitions of "burglary" included the common-law definition of burglary — breaking and entering of a dwelling at night with the intent to commit a felony once inside. But the difficulty with this approach was that modern definitions have strayed far from the common-law definition. For instance, most states allow entry without "breaking," allow burglary to occur during the daytime, and require no felonious intent once inside. "The arcane distinctions embedded in the common-law definition have little relevance to modern law enforcement concerns." Conversely, few acts that fall under the modern definition of "burglary" would also count as burglary under the common law. And although the Court sometimes applied the maxim that undefined statutory terms would carry the common-law definition, it reasoned that that maxim would not apply where the common-law definition was outmoded. For these reasons, the Court rejected the idea of reading § 924(e)'s definition of "burglary" as the common-law definition.
Before the Court, Taylor proposed a definition that defined "burglary" to include only "entering a building of another with the intent to commit a crime that has as an element conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another." The Court rejected this idea because it was not supported by the language of the statute. The statute says, "any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that is burglary." This suggested that Congress intended to include the entire scope of "burglary," not just some subset, as a predicate offense. "This choice of language indicates that Congress thought ordinary burglaries, as well as burglaries involving some element making them especially dangerous, presented a sufficiently 'serious potential risk' to count toward enhancement."
This left a "generic" meaning of the word "burglary" — an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime. If the defendant's prior conviction involves a crime with these basic elements, regardless of the label, it counts as a predicate offense under § 924(e).
The final step in the Court's analysis was to settle the question of how to prove whether a particular defendant's conviction qualifies as "generic burglary." If the state statute is narrower, then "there is no problem, because the conviction necessarily implies that the defendant has been found guilty of all the elements of generic burglary." If the state's definition of "burglary" matches the definition of "generic burglary," or varies from it only slightly, then that too is sufficient. However, where a state's definition of burglary is broader than the definition of "generic burglary," or where a state does not have a crime called "burglary," the problem of proving whether the conviction is for "generic burglary" is more difficult. The statute says "has three prior convictions," not "has thrice committed acts which." This suggests that it is the elements of the conviction rather than the facts supporting it that matters. In appropriate cases, the trial court may look past the statute of conviction to the indictment or information and the jury instructions to determine whether, with respect to any one of the defendant's prior convictions, he was convicted of a crime whose elements match the elements of "generic burglary."
Justice Scalia's concurrence
Justice Scalia concurred in the opinion of the Court, except for its discussion of the legislative history — the form the law took when it was a bill pending before Congress, and the statements various members of Congress made while it was pending. Justice Scalia believed that the text of the statute passed by Congress was the only thing that was important. "The examination [of the legislative history] does not uncover anything useful (i.e., anything that tempts us to alter the meaning we deduce from the text anyway), but that is the usual consequence of these inquiries (and a good thing, too)." Ultimately, though, Justice Scalia found the effort futile. "I can discern no reason for devoting 10 pages of today's opinion to legislative history, except to show that we have given this case close and careful consideration. We must find some better way of demonstrating our conscientiousness."

From "TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC" ==> """
TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC, 581 U.S. ___ (2017), was a United States Supreme Court case concerning the venue in patent infringement lawsuits.. 
While a 1957 Supreme Court ruling had determined that patent infringement cases were to be tried in the state within which the defendant was incorporated, subsequent changes to Judiciary and Judicial Procedure implemented by Congress had led courts to rule that infringement cases could be brought anywhere the defendant conducted business considered infringing. This enabled plaintiffs to forum shop for courts favorable to them. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas had become the most popular court for such cases, encouraging many non-practicing entities—so-called "patent trolls"—to use this court to seek litigation and settlements from larger companies.
The Court ruled unanimously in favor of the petitioner, upholding its 1957 decision that patent infringement cases must be heard in the district within which the defendant is incorporated.
Background
United States law under Title 28 of the United States Code (U.S.C.) covering judiciary procedure states that patent infringement lawsuits are to be held in the district court where the defendant (the party charged with patent infringement) "resides", under 28 U.S.C. § 1400(b).. Congress added clarifying language in 1988 to the general statute related to civil cases, 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c)(2), stating that for a corporation, its place of residence is "in any judicial district in which such defendant is subject to the court’s personal jurisdiction with respect to the civil action in question".. Subsequent rulings by federal courts effectively allowed plaintiffs in patent infringement cases to select any district court in whose jurisdiction the defendant did business, e.g., where it sold its products. This determination had been most recently affirmed in a 1990 case VE Holding Corporation v. Johnson Gas Appliance Company in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Congress amended 28 U.S.C. § 1391 again in 2011, but did not change how courts interpreted the venue system.
This effectively allowed plaintiffs to file suit in nearly any district court of their choosing, arguing that defendants that sold products anywhere in the United States were doing business in that court's jurisdiction, creating a type of forum shopping. This led to a large number of patent infringement cases being filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The Eastern District of Texas was considered to be favorable to plaintiffs: trials were resolved quickly and plaintiffs prevailed in 75% of cases. The speedy resolution of cases was in part due to procedures set up by Judge T. John Ward, appointed to the court in 1999, that kept patent infringement cases to a strict time table. In 2017, the Eastern District of Texas saw the most patent infringement cases of any district court, with one judge overseeing 25% of all such cases in the nation. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware also sees a large number of such cases, partly because of the many businesses incorporated in Delaware.
The Eastern District of Texas attracted a large number of non-practicing entities, derogatorily known as "patent trolls", in addition to other patent infringement complaints. These are individuals or companies that do not actually do business but who have gained ownership of patents which most others would see as low-quality patents that are either overly broad or lack inventiveness. These entities file suit against other companies for patent infringement, typically as means to coerce settlement prior to trial or anticipating a victory in the district court of their choosing. A study found that since 2014, more than 90% of the patent infringement cases heard in the Eastern District of Texas were from such non-practicing entities.
Case background
Kraft Foods sued TC Heartland, another food manufacturer, of patent infringement related to one of its low-calorie sweeteners. Kraft Foods sought legal action in the District of Delaware despite the fact that TC Heartland, an Indiana-based company, had no physical presence in Delaware. TC Heartland sought to change the venue to the Southern District of Indiana, citing the Supreme Court decision in Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Products Corp.  that for purposes of patent infringement suits, a corporation "resides" in the state within which it was incorporated. The District Court, and subsequently the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, rejected TC Heartland's argument, stating that the amended language of 28 U.S.C. § 1391 since the decision of Fourco clarified how to determine where a company resides and that past cases at the District and Appeals Court have relied on this interpretation.
Supreme Court
TC Heartland filed a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court in September 2016, specifically addressing whether the interpretation of "resides" in 28 U.S.C. § 1400 can be affected by the amendments made to 28 U.S.C. § 1391; the Court granted certiorari in December 2016. Supporting TC Heartland via amicus briefs included a number of computer, technology, banking, and retail companies such as Apple, eBay, IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and Walmart that sought to eliminate the means that their patents are challenged by non-practicing entities, as well as seventeen states. Amicus briefs in opposition to TC Heartland included a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Allergan, Merck, and Genentech, who stated the ability to decide the venue helped to fend themselves against generic drug manufacturers, and older companies like Ericsson and Whirlpool which have thousands of patents in their portfolio and having the choice of venue making it easy for them to deal with large number of patent infractions in a single location.
Oral arguments were heard before the eight-member court on March 27, 2017. Justice Neil Gorsuch had yet to be appointed at this time and did not participate in the decision. The petitioner, TC Heartland, was represented by James W. Dabney and patent law academic John F. Duffy. William F. Jay argued on behalf of the respondent, Kraft.  Observers noted that the justices focused on their previous decision from Fourco and argued the Federal Circuit had been "ignoring our decision", as stated by Justice Elena Kagan. The question of the impact of a decision in favor of TC Heartland was raised, noting that a decision favoring TC Heartland would cause other District Courts, particularly Delaware's, to be loaded with patent infringement cases.
The Court issued its decision on June 26, 2017, ruling unanimously that the definition of "reside" in 28 U.S.C. § 1400 remains as determined by the Court in Fourco to be the state of incorporation for a company. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing the opinion, found that the 2011 updates to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 did not contradict the Fourco decision, nor incorporated elements of the ruling from VE Holdings, and thus, their decision of Fourco still holds. The Court reversed the decision of the Appeals Court and remanded the case back to them.
Impact
A separate patent infringement case, Raytheon Co. v. Cray, Inc., brought to the Eastern District of Texas during the Supreme Court case. Cray argued for a change of venue claiming it did not have a place of business in the district. Chief Judge James Gilstrap for the District Court initially ruled in April 2017 prior to the Supreme Court decision that Raytheon could seek action against Cray in the district. Following the Supreme Court's decision in TC Heartland in May 2017, Cray requested Gilstrap to re-evaluate the case under this ruling. Gilstrap did issue a new ruling, though still denying the change of venue. Gilstrap created a four-point test to evaluate whether a defendant had "regular and established place of business" in the district, and as Cray had a single sales representative living within the district, he denied the motion to change venue. Cray appealed to the Federal Circuit, which was heard after the TC Heartland decision. The Federal Circuit applied the Supreme Court's reasoning to reverse Gilstrap's ruling and allowed Cray's motion to transfer the case to proceed. Coupled with the TC Heartland ruling, this decision was seen to prevent further attempts by plaintiffs to forum shop for a desired court.
The filing of such cases in the Eastern District of Texas, formerly the leader in such suits, dropped after this decision. Meanwhile, the filing of such cases in the District of Delaware increased.Patent lawsuits drop 21 percent in the Eastern District of Texas as SCOTUS ruling brings new era, ABA Journal, July 19, 2017

This case addresses the Federal Court's threshold standard of deciding whether Constitutional claims will be heard. Application of the "Teague test" at the most basic level limits habeas corpus.
 Background 
The appeal was from a black defendant who was convicted by an all white jury in Illinois in a state court located in Cook County. The prosecutor had used all 10 of his peremptory challenges to exclude African American jurors but claimed he was trying to get a balance of men and women on the jury.
 Opinion of the Court 
The majority held that the actions of the prosecutor did not follow contemporary criminal procedure but that the Batson challenge should not be applied retroactively.

From "Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States" ==> """
Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States, 348 U.S. 272 (1955), is a United States Supreme Court case involving a suit by the Tee-Hit-Ton, a subgroup of the Tlingit people.  The Tee-Hit-Ton sought compensation from  Congress for lumber taken from lands they occupied. The court ruled against the Tee-Hit-Ton.
 Background 
The Tee-Hit-Ton, a subgroup of the Tlingit people, brought an action in Court of Claims for compensation, under Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, for timber taken from tribal-occupied lands in Alaska authorized by the Secretary of Agriculture. The tribe contended it had "full proprietary ownership" or at least a recognized right to unrestricted possession; the federal government asserted the opposite, and argued that if the tribe had any rights, they were to use the land at the government’s will.
 Procedural posture 
The tribe first filed a suit in the United States Court of Claims, which found that the tribe was an identifiable group residing in Alaska; its interest in the lands prior to the purchase of Alaska was an “original Indian title” but such a title was not enough to bring suit because the Congress did not recognize the tribe's legal rights of property ownership. The Court of Claims dismissed the tribe's suit.
Decision 
Justice Stanley Forman Reed, writing for the Court, stated that Congress did not intend to grant the Tee-Hit-Ton any permanent rights to the occupied lands but had given them permission to occupy it. Under the concept of conquest, any title to the land was extinguished when the "white man" came per Johnson v. M'Intosh. No case has held that taking of Indian title or use by Congress required compensation. Because there was no recognized title to the land, the court decided there was no right to compensation under the Fifth Amendment.

From "The Telephone Cases" ==> """
The Telephone Cases, 126 U.S. 1 (1888), were a series of U.S. court cases in the 1870s and the 1880s related to the invention of the telephone, which culminated in an 1888 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld the priority of the patents belonging to Alexander Graham Bell. Those patents were used by the American Bell Telephone Company and the Bell System, although they had also acquired critical microphone patents from Emile Berliner.
The objector (or plaintiff) in the Supreme Court case was initially the Western Union telegraph company, which was then a far-larger and better financed competitor than American Bell Telephone. Western Union advocated several more recent patent claims of Daniel Drawbaugh, Elisha Gray, Antonio Meucci, and Philip Reis in a bid to invalidate Alexander Graham Bell's master and subsidiary telephone patents dating from March 1876. A decision for Western Union would have immediately destroyed the Bell Telephone Company, and might have allowed the former company, instead of the latter, to become the world's largest telecommunications monopoly.
The Supreme Court came within one vote of overturning the Bell patent because of the eloquence of lawyer Lysander Hill for the Peoples Telephone Company. In a lower court, the Peoples Telephone Company stock rose briefly during the early proceedings but dropped after its claimant, Daniel Drawbaugh, took the stand and testified: "I don't remember how I came to it. I had been experimenting in that direction. I don't remember of getting at it by accident either. I don't remember of anyone talking to me of it."Billings, A. Bell and the Early Independents, Telephone Engineer and Management, March 15, 1985, pp87-89,
In the case, the Supreme Court affirmed: 
Dolbear v. American Bell Tel. Co., 15 F. 448, 17 F. 604, 
Molecular Tel. Co. v. American Bell Tel. Co., 32 F. 214, and 
People's Tel. Co. v. American Bell Tel. Co., 22 F. 309 and 25 F. 725. 
The Supreme Court reversed American Bell Tel Co. v. Molecular Tel. Co., 32 F. 214.
Bell's second fundamental patent expired on January 30, 1894, when the gates were then opened to independent telephone companies to compete with the Bell System. In all, the American Bell Telephone Company and its successor, AT&T, litigated 587 court challenges to its patents, including five that went to the US Supreme Court and, aside from two minor contract lawsuits, never lost a single case that was concluded with a final stage judgment.Australasian Telephone Collecting Society. Who Really Invented The Telephone?, ATCS, Moorebank, NSW, Australia. Retrieved from www.telephonecollecting.org website on April 22, 2011.
Size
The Court's decision in the Telephone Cases is notable for the size of the opinions delivered; together, they occupy the entire 126th volume of the United States Reports.
 Notable cases 
Among the notable court cases involving the Bell Telephone Company, later renamed to the American Bell Telephone Company, were those related to challenges by Elisha Gray, a principal in Western Electric, as depicted in the Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy.
Additionally the Bell Company became embroiled in a number of challenges from those companies associated with Antonio Meucci, as shown in the Canadian Parliamentary Motion on Alexander Graham Bell, itself a response to the United States HRes. 269 on Antonio Meucci.

Tellabs Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, 551 U.S. 308 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled on the interpretation of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995's requirement of scienter in a civil action in  apply to Tellabs and Makor Issues & Rights.OYEZ article  The various federal circuits have taken different approaches to defining what it means, under the PSLRA, for a plaintiff to sufficiently plead a "strong inference" of scienter (a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud).
The Court ruled a reasonable inference of scienter from assumed-true facts was insufficient and inconsistent with Congressional intent. Writing for the Court, Justice Ginsburg wrote that "to qualify as "strong" within the intendment of § 21D(b)(2), we hold, an inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or reasonable - it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent...the inference of scienter must be more than merely "reasonable" or "permissible"-it must be cogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other explanations. A complaint will survive, we hold, only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged."Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 127 S.Ct. 2499, 2504-05 (2007).
Tellabs increased the hurdle civil litigants must traverse in order to recover damages for securities fraud because it made it more difficult to demonstrate scienter (a necessary element of the claim).  Instead of being able to reasonably deduce scienter from the alleged facts of the case, a claimant must also demonstrate that fraud is at least as likely as other, more-innocent explanations.

Tenet v. Doe, 544 U.S. 1 (2005), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the court ruled unanimously that spies (those recruited for espionage by the Central Intelligence Agency) cannot sue the CIA or the United States government to enforce an espionage contract. The court ruled that allowing such suits jeopardize the protection of state secrets.
This case pitted Doe and his wife against the CIA. Doe, a high-ranking Soviet diplomat, was recruited by the CIA for espionage against Soviet Union during the Cold War. When he was recruited, the CIA promised to resettle him, and his wife, in the United States and ensure financial security for life. The couple settled in Washington state, where Doe found employment. His salary increased to the point that he agreed to discontinue the CIA benefits while he was working. Years later, in 1997, Doe was laid off. Unable to find new employment, due to restrictions by the CIA on the types of jobs he could hold, he then contacted the CIA to reinstate the financial assistance. That request was denied by the CIA, which provided no avenue for Doe to appeal the decision.
Doe brought the suit before the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The District Court denied the Government's motions to dismiss and the case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court considered this case in light of the 1876 case, Totten v. United States, which prevented a spy from suing the United States to enforce a secret espionage contract. In considering Tenet v. Doe, the Supreme Court upheld the Totten v. United States decision. Therefore, the law continues to deny Doe and other spies the right to sue the United States and the CIA for alleged violations of espionage agreements.

From "Tennard v. Dretke" ==> """
Tennard v. Dretke, 542 U.S. 274 (2004), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court was asked whether evidence of the defendant's low IQ  in a death penalty trial had been adequately presented to the jury for full consideration in the penalty phase of his trial.. The Supreme Court held that not considering a defendant's low IQ would breach his Eighth Amendment rights and constitute a cruel and unusual punishment.
Facts of the case
Robert Tennard  was convicted of capital murder by a Texas jury.  Tennard and two accomplices robbed and killed two neighbors.  The evidence presented at trial indicated that Tennard killed one of the victims by stabbing while his accomplice used a hatchet to kill the other victim. In the evidence phase of the trial, the defense presented evidence that Tennard's IQ was 67, a fact which the prosecution did not dispute. The prosecutors argued that Tennard's IQ was irrelevant to the case.
The jury was instructed to evaluate two issues: did the defendant deliberately commit the crime, and was the defendant likely to be dangerous in the future? The jury answered yes to both questions and sentenced Tennard to death.
The defense then argued that the jury instructions in the penalty phase were inadequate, and Tennard's death penalty was in violation of the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment.
Questions at issue
The District Court for the Southern District of Texas denied Tennard a certificate to appeal on the basis that a low IQ is not a sufficient reason for appeal there was no evidence presented that Tennard's behavior was mentally retarded and that mental retardation was related to the criminal act. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this finding. The Supreme Court granted Tennard's writ of certiorari.
Issue
The U.S. Supreme Court then vacated the decision and remanded it back to the Fifth Circuit for reconsideration in light of the court's contemporaneous decision in Atkins v. Virginia. The Fifth Circuit considered and rejected the Atkins claim. Tennard appealed again.
The main issue the U.S Supreme Court considered was whether the Fifth Circuit improperly denied Mr. Tennard's certificate of appeal since he had presented substantial evidence of a violation of his constitutional rights, or had "demonstrated that reasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong?" (quotation in original).
Outcome
The Supreme Court held that all relevant mitigating factors must be considered in the penalty phase of a death penalty case. It is not sufficient to allow the defendant to present mitigating factors during the trial if those factors are not considered in the sentencing. If the jury is not instructed to consider  all relevant mitigating factors, the defendant's Eighth Amendment rights are violated as failure to do so constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The court concluded that Tennard's IQ was a relevant mitigating factor, and that the sentencing jury should have been made to consider it for the purposes of mitigation.
Ultimately, Tennard's death sentence was reduced to life in prison.http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_offenders_no_longer_on_dr.html
Significance
The case formed part of a series of decisions in which the Supreme Court adjusted and refined the capital sentencing methods of the various states.

Tennessee Coal, Iron & Railroad Co. v. Muscoda Local No. 123, 321 U.S. 590 (1944), was an important decision of the United States Supreme Court with regard to the interpretation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)..  This set a precedent for an expansive construction of the language of the FLSA.
Facts
Three iron ore companies filed a declarative action to determine whether time spent by their employees traveling underground to their work sites constituted employment for which compensation was due under the FLSA.321 U.S. at 592.  The district court found that this transit time was work, and the appellate court affirmed its holding as to travel time.321 U.S. at 593.
Judgment
The Court, in an opinion written by Justice Murphy, held that the  miners' travel time constituted "work" under the Fair Labor Standards Act, entitling them to pay for such time.321 U.S. at 603.  The Court stated that the Fair Labor Standards Act is a “remedial and humanitarian” statute, which “must not be interpreted or applied in a narrow, grudging manner.”321 U.S. at 597.  Congress intended the Act to mandate either regular or overtime compensation for all work activities.
Concurring opinions
Justices Jackson and Frankfurter each wrote a short concurrence.  Both argued that the determination of the trial court that the miners' travel time was part of their workweek was an issue of fact that should be affirmed unless clear error was present.321 U.S. at 603-606.
Dissenting opinion
Justice Roberts dissented in an opinion joined by Chief Justice Stone.  Viewing the court's interpretation of the FLSA as overly expansive, Justice Roberts emphasized the importance of interpreting what is written in a statute, rather than what the court wishes is in the statute.321 U.S. at 606.

From "Tennessee v. Garner" ==> """
Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985), is a civil case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that, under the Fourth Amendment, when a law enforcement officer is pursuing a fleeing suspect, the officer may not use deadly force to prevent escape unless "the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.".
It was found that the use of deadly force to prevent escape is an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, in the absence of probable cause that the fleeing suspect posed a physical danger.Criminal Law - Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder, , 
Facts and procedural history
At about 10:45 p.m. on October 3, 1974, Memphis police officers Leslie Wright and Elton Hymon were dispatched to answer a burglary call.  Officer Hymon went behind the house as his partner radioed back to the station.  Hymon witnessed someone running across the yard.  The fleeing suspect, Edward Garner, stopped at a  chain-link fence.  Using his flashlight, Hymon could see Garner's face and hands, and was reasonably sure that Garner was unarmed.  The police testified that they believed Garner was 17 or 18 years old; Garner was in fact 15 years old. After Hymon ordered Garner to halt, Garner began to climb the fence.  Believing that Garner would certainly flee if he made it over the fence, Hymon shot him.  The bullet struck Garner in the back of the head, and he died shortly after an ambulance took him to a nearby hospital.  Ten dollars and a purse taken from the burglarized house were found on his person.
Hymon acted according to a Tennessee state statute and official Memphis Police Department policy authorizing deadly force against a fleeing suspect.  The statute provided that "if, after notice of the intention to arrest the defendant, he either flee or forcibly resist, the officer may use all the necessary means to effect the arrest."
Garner's father then brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, , naming the City of Memphis, its mayor, the Memphis Police Department, its director, and Officer Hymon as defendants.  The District Court found the statute, and Hymon's actions, to be constitutional.  On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed.  The Court of Appeals held that the killing of a fleeing suspect is a "seizure" for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment, and is therefore constitutional only when it is reasonable.  The Court then found that based on the facts in this case, the Tennessee statute failed to properly limit the use of deadly force by reference to the seriousness of the felony.
Tennessee appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld the finding of the Court of Appeals.
Opinion of the Court
Justice White wrote for the majority, first agreeing with the Sixth Circuit's determination that apprehension by use of deadly force is a seizure, then framing the legal issue as whether the totality of the circumstances justified the seizure. In order to determine the constitutionality of a seizure, White reasoned, the court must weigh the nature of the intrusion of the suspect's Fourth Amendment rights against the government interests which justified the intrusion.
The use of deadly force against a subject is the most intrusive type of seizure possible, because it deprives the suspect of his life, and White held that the state failed to present evidence that its interest in shooting unarmed fleeing suspects outweighs the suspect's interest in his own survival.
White examined the common law rule on this matter and its rationale. At common law, it was perfectly legitimate for law enforcement personnel to kill a fleeing felon.  At the time when this rule was first created, most felonies were punishable by death, and the difference between felonies and misdemeanors was relatively large. In modern American law, neither of these circumstances existed. Furthermore, the common law rule developed at a time before modern firearms, and most law enforcement officers did not carry handguns. The context in which the common law rule evolved was no longer valid. White further noted that many jurisdictions had already done away with it, and that current research has shown that the use of deadly force contributes little to the deterrence of crime or the protection of the public.
On the basis of the facts found by the district court, Hymon had no reason to believe that Garner was armed or dangerous. The Court ordered the case remanded for a determination on the liability of the other defendants.
Dissent
In her dissent, Justice O'Connor highlighted the fact that police officers must often make swift, spur-of-the-moment decisions while on patrol, and argued that the robbery, and assault that happen in the home are related to the already serious crime of burglary. The Tennessee statute represents the state legislature's judgment that such crimes may require the use of deadly force in order to protect the public against those who commit such crimes. She also disagreed that a suspect's interest in his own life necessarily allows the right to flee from the scene of a crime when pursued, thereby escaping due process, although the majority did not find nor articulate any "right to flee".
Limitations of impact
Garner brought his suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which extends to citizens' protection from violations of their civil rights by "persons", including persons acting in their official capacity as officers of the states. Accordingly, the Court's holding under this Section sets a standard that state police departments must comply with. In practice, however, the Garner case has had less impact on state-level police practices than was originally anticipated. This is because Garner, and a subsequent case, Graham v. Connor,. established that the reasonableness of an officer's use of force, whether against a fleeing suspect or otherwise, is to be determined from the perspective of the officer under the circumstances that were apparent to them at the time. As the Graham court made clear, this deferential standard prevents most second-guessing of an officer's judgment about use of force. It may be that Garner's legacy is not so much one of changing the use of deadly force by police as it is of eliding use of force policies and practices by shifting them from the statutory to the customary.
Tennenbaum shows a significant reduction (16%) in the number of police homicides committed before, and after the decision.  This reduction was more significant in states which declared their laws regarding police use of deadly force to be unconstitutional after the Garner decision.  The evidence suggests that the reduction is due not only to a reduction in shooting fleeing felons, but also to a general reduction in police shooting.  These empirical findings prove, that despite suspicion about the ability of the Supreme Court to change police discretion, the Garner decision demonstrates that a decision can have a strong effect on police behavior.

From "Tennessee v. Lane" ==> """
Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), was a case in the Supreme Court of the United States involving Congress's enforcement powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment..
Background
The plaintiffs were disabled Tennesseans who could not access the upper floors in state courthouses. They sued in federal court, arguing that since Tennessee was denying them public services because of their disabilities, it was violating Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Under Title II, no one can be denied access to public services due to his or her disability; it allows those whose rights have been violated to sue states for money damages.
Tennessee argued that the Eleventh Amendment prohibited the suit, and filed a motion to dismiss the case. It relied principally on Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett (2001), in which the Supreme Court held that Congress had, in enacting certain provisions of the ADA, unconstitutionally abrogated the sovereign immunity of the States by letting people sue the States for discrimination on the basis of disability. That case, in turn, relied on the rule laid down by City of Boerne v. Flores: Congress may abrogate the Eleventh Amendment using its section 5 powers only if the way it seeks to remedy discrimination is "congruent and proportional" to the discrimination itself. Garrett had held that Congress had not met the congruent-and-proportional test – i.e., that it had not amassed enough evidence of discrimination on the basis of disability to justify the abrogation of sovereign immunity.
Opinion of the Court
In Lane, the Supreme Court split 5–4. In the majority opinion written by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court ruled that Congress did have enough evidence that disabled people were being denied those fundamental rights that are protected by the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, among those rights being the right to access a court. Further, the remedy Congress enacted was congruent and proportional, because the "reasonable accommodations" mandated by the ADA were not unduly burdensome and disproportionate to the harm. Garrett, the Court said, applied only to Equal Protection claims, not to Due Process claims. Therefore, the law was constitutional. Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia filed dissents.

From "Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill" ==> """
Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hiram Hill et al., or TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978), was a United States Supreme Court case and the Court's first interpretation of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  After the discovery of the snail darter fish in the Little Tennessee River in August 1973, a lawsuit was filed alleging that the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)'s Tellico Dam construction was in violation of the Endangered Species Act.  Plaintiffs argued dam construction would destroy critical habitat and endanger the population of snail darters.  It was decided by a 6-3 vote, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hill, et al. and granted an injunction stating that there would be conflict between Tellico Dam operation and the explicit provisions of Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.
The majority opinion, delivered by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, affirmed the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in granting an injunction..   This decision by the Supreme Court to not allow exemptions confirmed that Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act was a strong substantive provision and helped shape federal environmental law.   The case is commonly cited as an example of the strict construction-plain meaning canon of construction, and the equitable principle that courts cannot balance equities to override statutory mandates unless on constitutional grounds.
 Background 
 History of Endangered Species Act 
Passed by Congress a large majority in 531-4 vote and signed by President Richard Nixon on December 28, 1973  with the purpose of protecting and recovering "imperiled species and the ecosystems upon which they depend," the Endangered Species Act provides the strongest federal protection against species loss.  The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to evaluate if actions taken or permitted by the federal government may harm listed species or the continued existence of listed species or their critical habitat.  Once a species is listed as "endangered" or "threatened," the ESA prohibits the "taking" of listed animals and plants which makes it unlawful "to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect or attempt to engage in any such conduct."  Unknowingly at the time, Congress had passed a controversial statute that created a forum which brought into question the merits of government projects and presented a political question of balancing the benefits of species preservation and the economic cost of preservation.
 Parties involved 
 Tennessee Valley Authority 
thumbnail|right|Location of Tellico Dam
The Tennessee Valley Authority is a federally owned utility corporation created in 1933 during the Great Depression.  At the time of its creation, its mission was to help strengthen economic development of the Tennessee River basin, a region hit with high unemployment where the per capita income was less than half the national average.  The publicly owned corporation provides flood control, navigation and land management for the Tennessee River system and assists utilities and state and local governments with economic development.  The Tellico Dam project would be the last of 68 dams constructed in the Tennessee River Valley.  TVA argued that the project would provide recreational benefits and allow for real estate development along the reservoir.
 Hiram Hill, et al. 
Hiram (Hank) Hill was a second year law student at the University of Tennessee.  Hiram Hill was spending time with Dr. David Etnier, a biologist and professor, who had discovered the snail darter while scuba diving in the Little Tennessee River.  Hill brought the snail darter to the attention of Zygmunt J.B. Plater, a law professor, and asked if the completion of the Tellico Dam and the potential effect on the fish under the Endangered Species Act would be a suitable topic for an environmental law paper. The plaintiffs in the case were Hill, Plater, and Donald Cohen.

 Case 
 History of the case 
In previous suits filed by Environmental Defense Fund under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), TVA had been ordered by Judge Robert L. Taylor of the Eastern District of Tennessee to cease dam construction for 16 months until an environmental impact statement had been written. Congress continued to fund the project under the annual Public Works Appropriations Act and Judge Taylor dissolved the injunction after a year and dismissed the NEPA suit.
After the discovery of the snail darter, Hiram Hill, Zygmunt Plater, and local attorney Joseph Congleton  submitted a petition to the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the snail darter as endangered.  In the Federal Register, the FWS ruled that the species was indeed endangered and designated mile 0.5 to 17 of the Little Tennessee River as critical habitat for snail darters.  TVA rejected the Fish and Wildlife Service's interpretation of ESA and continued to receive funding for the Tellico Dam.
On February 28, 1976 Hill et al., filed a citizen's suit seeking an injunction and claimed that TVA was in violation of the Endangered Species Act.  Judge Taylor presided over the case and on May 25, 1976 he found that the dam would eliminate the fish and its habitat, but he refused to consider balancing the alternate development of the river, and refused to enjoin completion of the Tellico Dam.
On January 31, 1977 the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Taylor's decision and issued an injunction forbidding the completion of the dam. During this time TVA petitioned the FWS to remove the snail darter from the endangered species list and also petitioned for a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court.
 Issues 
It was not disputed by either party that the completion of the dam would eradicate the known population of snail darters.  The two issues of the case were as follows:
 Whether completion of the Tellico Dam by the Tennessee Valley Authority would violate the Endangered Species Act. And, if so
 Whether an injunction is required to halt construction of the dam.
 Arguments 
 Arguments against an injunction 
On April 18, 1978 TVA argued that an exception to the Endangered Species Act should be granted for balancing of equities.  They argued that Congress had already spent $100 million on the project, and that it would not make economic sense to stop the project.  TVA argued for an exception to be made in this case since the dam was started prior to the Endangered Species Act being passed and claimed it should be grandfathered in.  Another argument made was that since the appropriations committees continued to appropriate funding for the project after knowing it would be detrimental to the snail darter's critical habitat, Congress had implicitly repealed the Endangered Species Act.
 Arguments for an injunction 
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act offers no exceptions to the jeopardizing of the continued existence of listed endangered species or their habitat.  Endangered species should be afforded the highest of priorities no matter the economic costs.
 Opinions of the Court 
 Majority opinion 
The majority opinion was made by Chief Justice Burger, joined by justices William J. Brennan, Jr., Potter Stewart, Byron White, Thurgood Marshall, and John Paul Stevens was delivered on June 15, 1978.  Burger affirmed that the Endangered Species Act is very clear in its wording:
One would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies 'to insure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence' of an endangered species or 'result in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species . . . .' 16 U.S.C. 1536 (1976 ed.). (Emphasis added.) This language admits of no exception.
Based on the wording of the Act, Congress viewed the value of an endangered species as incalculable.  Until Congress decided otherwise, the courts should enforce the law, not allowing violations to continue.
To TVA's claim that Congress had implied repeal of the Endangered Species Act Burger wrote: "When voting on appropriations measures, legislators are entitled to operate under the assumption that the funds will be devoted to purposes which are lawful and not for any purpose forbidden."
 Dissenting opinions 
 Dissenting Powell, joined by Blackmun 
Justices Lewis F. Powell, Jr. and Harry Blackmun agreed with the majority opinion with the wording of the Endangered Species Act, but disagreed that there could not be exception.
...I view it as the duty of this Court to adopt a permissible construction that accords with some modicum of common sense and the public weal.
Powell thought it rationally followed that since the dam construction began before the ESA was passed, the statute did not apply to projects already underway.
 Dissenting Rehnquist 
Justice William Rehnquist agreed with the District Court in their refusal to issue an injunction.
Here the District Court recognized that Congress, when it enacted the Endangered Species Act, made the preservation of the habitat of the snail darter an important public concern. But it concluded that this interest on one side of the balance was more than outweighed by other equally significant factors. These factors, further elaborated in the dissent of my brother Powell, satisfy me that the District Court's refusal to issue an injunction was not an abuse of its discretion. I therefore dissent from the Court's opinion holding otherwise.
He agreed that TVA was in violation of the Endangered Species Act, but thought there should be a balancing of equities in this case.  Just because they could issue an injunction, does not mean they had an absolute duty to do so.
 Subsequent developments 
Congress amends the Endangered Species Act 
Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1978 were introduced by Senators Howard Baker and John C. Culver. The subsequent amendments brought "some flexibility into the Endangered Species Act".U.S. Congress (1979). “Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1978, Legislative History.” U.S. Code Congressional and Administrating News Volume 7. St. Paul, Minnesota: West Publishing Co. As part of the amendment Congress created the Endangered Species Committee composed of seven senior officials:
 Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,
 Administrator of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
 Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers,
 Secretary of Agriculture,
 Secretary of the Army,
 Secretary of the Interior, and
 a representative of the state in question.
The committee has the authority to exempt federal agencies from provisions in Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. An exemption could be granted if a majority of the committee members found:
 (a) the federal project is of regional or national significance,
 (b) there is no "reasonable and prudent alternative," and
 (c) the project as proposed "clearly outweighs the alternatives."
If approved, the extinction of a species would be allowed and the agency would be required to implement a mitigation plan.
The Tellico Dam project was reviewed by the so-called "God Committee" on January 23, 1979 and was unanimously denied an exemption based on economic factors. Chairman Andrus stated, "I hate to see the snail darter get the credit for stopping a project that was ill-conceived and uneconomic in the first place." The annual cost of the dam, $7.25 million, exceeded estimated benefits, $6.25 million, in addition to the cost of completing dam construction and also would tie up approximately $40 million in private (agricultural) land values.
thumbnail|Completed Tellico Dam
 Rider to the appropriations bill 
Determined to have the Tellico Dam completed, Senator Baker and Representative John Duncan, Sr. rejected the economic analysis and attached a rider into the Energy and Water Development Appropriation Act in July 1979 directing TVA to complete the construction of the Tellico Dam.  The appropriations bill was signed by President Jimmy Carter allowing the project to be completed and a reservoir began to form later in the year.  Although that population of the snail darter did not survive, several small populations were later found upstream in the Tennessee River and its tributaries.Energy and Water Development Appropriation Act, 1980 Public Law 96-69 (93 STA. 449) The snail darter is still on the Endangered Species List, though it was down-graded to "threatened" after being successfully transplanted into other river systems.Etnier, DA & Starnes, WC. 1993. The fishes of Tennessee. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press.
 Role in subsequent high profile environmental cases 
CaseIssueHoldingWashington Toxics Coalition v. Environmental Protection Agency, 2004  The environmental organization, WTC, argued use of 54 pesticides with active ingredients may harm endangered or threatened salmon and steelhead in the waters of the Pacific Northwest.  WTC filed suit against the EPA to force consulting compliance under the ESA  District court upheld an injunction banning the use of the 54 pesticides within the proscribed distance of waters supporting salmon populations in California, Oregon, and Washington.Entergy Corp. v. Riverkeeper Inc., 2009  Under the Clean Water Act facilities are regulated to use the "Best Available Technology" to reduce adverse impacts to the environment.  The case determined whether agencies may use cost-benefit analysis when choosing a technology to meet performance standards.  The Court determined the EPA was allowed to use cost-benefit analysis when determining BAT standards.Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a Great Oregon, 1995  Sweet Home Chapter brought suit against the Secretary of Interior and the director of the Fish and Wildlife Service challenging the interpretation of the term "take" in the Endangered Species Act. The plaintiff argued that the interpretation of "harm" under "takings" was too broad and any commercial business would indirectly impact habitat and species.  The Court ruled in favor of the Department of Interior finding "that Congress intended an expansive interpretation that encompasses habitat modification."

From "Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Assn. v. Thomas" ==> """
Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association v. Thomas, No. 18-96, 588 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case which held that Tennessee's two-year durational-residency requirement applicable to retail liquor store license applicants violated the Commerce Clause (Dormant Commerce Clause) and was not authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment.
 Background 
The state of Tennessee imposed a series of durational-residency requirements on all people and businesses seeking to obtain or renew a license to operate a liquor store. This included a two-year durational-residency requirement for applicants of initial licenses. Total Wine & More applied to open a store in Knoxville, Tennessee which the state intended to approve based on the state Attorney General's opinion that the residency requirements were unenforceable. The trade group representing existing retailers sued the state to prevent approval.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit struck down all of the provisions as violations of the Commerce Clause. Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association petitioned the ruling pertaining to the two-year residency requirement. Case was heard by the Supreme Court of the United States.
 Issue 
Does Tennessee's two-year residency requirement for the obtaining of a liquor license violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution?
 Ruling 
The Court applies the principle known as the "Dormant Commerce Clause" or "negative Commerce Clause" which prohibits state laws that unduly restrict interstate commerce. The Court upheld the 6th Circuit ruling, striking down the two-year provision as unconstitutional.

From "Terminiello v. City of Chicago" ==> """
Terminiello v. City of Chicago, 337 U.S. 1 (1949), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a "breach of peace" ordinance of the City of Chicago that banned speech that "stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition of unrest, or creates a disturbance" was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.. 
Background
Arthur Terminiello, a Catholic priest under suspension, gave a speech to the Christian Veterans of America in which he criticized various racial groups and made a number of inflammatory comments. There were approximately 800 people present in the auditorium during the speech and a crowd of approximately 1,000 people outside, protesting the speech. The Chicago Police Department was present, but was unable to maintain order completely. 
Terminiello was later assessed a fine of $100 dollars for violation of Chicago's breach of peace ordinance, which he appealed. Both the Illinois Appellate Court and Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.City of Chicago v. Terminiello, 332 Ill. App. 17, 74 N.E.2d 45 (App. 1st Dist. 1947); affirmed, 400 Ill. 23, 79 N.E.2d 39 (1948). The US Supreme Court granted certiorari..
Majority opinion
Justice William O. Douglas, writing for the majority, reversed Terminiello's conviction, holding that his speech was protected by the First Amendment (which was made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment), and that the ordinance, as construed by the Illinois courts, was unconstitutional. Douglas said that the purpose of free speech was to invite dispute even where it incites people to anger; in fact, the provocative and inflammatory content of speech could potentially be seen as positive. 
Although Douglas acknowledged that freedom of speech was not limitless and did not apply to "fighting words" (citing Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire), he held that such limitations were inapplicable in this case:
The vitality of civil and political institutions in our society depends on free discussion. As Chief Justice Hughes wrote in De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353, 365, 260, it is only through free debate and free exchange of ideas that government remains responsive to the will of the people and peaceful change is effected. The right to speak freely and to promote diversity of ideas and programs is therefore one of the chief distinctions that sets us apart from totalitarian regimes.
Accordingly a function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea. That is why freedom of speech, though not absolute, Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra, 315 U.S. at pages 571-572, 62 S.Ct. at page 769, is nevertheless protected against censorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest. See Bridges v. California, 314 U.S. 252, 262, 193, 159 A.L.R. 1346; Craig v. Harney, 331 U.S. 367, 373, 1253. There is no room under our Constitution for a more restrictive view. For the alternative would lead to standardization of ideas either by legislatures, courts, or dominant political or community groups.Terminiello, 337 U.S. at 4-5.
Dissenting opinions
Vinson's dissent
Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson dissented on the ground that the jury instruction that to which the majority of the Supreme Court objected had been affirmed by both appellate courts. He felt that the Illinois courts had construed the ordinance only as punishing fighting words and that petitioner's counsel had not previously objected to the instruction on constitutional grounds.
Frankfurter's dissent
Justice Felix Frankfurter largely echoed the sentiments of Chief Justice Vinson, feeling that the majority was going out of its way to reverse Terminiello's fine, when such an action went against the balance of power between the federal and state courts:
Freedom of speech undoubtedly means freedom to express views that challenge deep-seated, sacred beliefs and to utter sentiments that may provoke resentment. But those indulging in such stuff as that to which this proceeding gave rise are hardly so deserving as to lead this Court to single them out as beneficiaries of the first departure from the restrictions that bind this Court in reviewing judgments of State courts. Especially odd is it to bestow such favor not for the sake of life or liberty, but to save a small amount of property — $100, the amount of the fine imposed upon the petitioner in a proceeding which is civil, not criminal, under the laws of Illinois, and thus subject only to limited review.Terminiello, 337 U.S. at 11-12 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).
Jackson's dissent
Justice Jackson's dissent was considerably longer and more elaborate than Vinson's or Frankfurter's. Jackson felt the majority was ignoring the very real concern of maintaining public order, and that the majority's generalized suspicion of any restriction of free speech was blinding them to the fact that a riot was at Terminiello's place of speaking. His basic argument was that although the First Amendment protects the expression of ideas, it does not protect them absolutely, in all circumstances, regardless of the danger it may create to the public at large. To underscore his point, Jackson reiterated the testimony given at trial by Terminiello, as well as excerpts from Terminiello's speech, in which he made anti-semitic remarks, inflammatory comments about various U.S. government officials, and statements praising fascist leaders, in order to demonstrate the chaotic and violent situation in which Terminiello was speaking.
Jackson framed Terminiello's speech and the violent fracas that surrounded it in the context of the global struggle between fascism and communism in the post-World War II world.  He feared that these two groups, dominated as they were by radicals and accustomed to using violent means to propagate their ideology, were a threat to legitimate democratic governments and that the court's decision would greatly reduce the power of local law enforcement authorities to keep such violence in check. In doing so, Jackson quoted from Mein Kampf, to date the only reference to the Hitler work in a Supreme Court opinion. Jackson also noted that without the help of the Chicago Police Department, Terminiello would not have even been able to give his speech and that the majority's opinion was not in line with the "clear and present danger" test set forth in Schenck v. United States.
Jackson's dissent in this case is most famous for its final paragraph:
This Court has gone far toward accepting the doctrine that civil liberty means the removal of all restraints from these crowds and that all local attempts to maintain order are impairments of the liberty of the citizen. The choice is not between order and liberty. It is between liberty with order and anarchy without either. There is danger that, if the Court does not temper its doctrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom, it will convert the constitutional Bill of Rights into a suicide pact.Terminiello, 337 U.S. at 36 (Jackson, J., dissenting).

From "Terrace v. Thompson" ==> """
Terrace v. Thompson, 263 U.S. 197 (1923), decided by U.S. Supreme Court on November 12, 1923, was a case challenging Washington Alien Land Law that is preventing aliens purchasing, using, or leasing the land. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the decision of state that Due Process and Equal Protection clause of Fourteenth Amendment and the treaty between the United States and Japan are not conflicted. 
Background
Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1911
In 1911, the United States make an agreement with Japan, guaranteeing the rights of Japanese in U.S. as an extension of the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907 and lessening anti-Japanese sentiment.
Alien Land Law
In 1913, California as a first state started implementing Alien Land Law. In the rise of anti-Asian sentiment, it used “aliens ineligible to citizenship” instead of addressing Japanese directly. Few years later, similar law was enacted in Washington that banning land ownership “by aliens other than those who in good faith have declared their intention to become citizens of the United States.” It implied those aliens are not eligible for citizenship, they never could declare to be naturalized “in good faith.”
Case
Terrace was a citizen of both the United States and Washington State. He was a farmer and wanted to lease his land to Nakatsuaka for five years, who was born in Japan and Japanese descent. The Attorney General was claiming Alien Land Law and trying to prosecute the enforcement criminally which even could lead to a confiscation of the land and imprisonment.
The appellants argued that the enforcement of Alien Land Law was a transgression of due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1911. They claimed it is contradictory to the Fourteenth Amendment because of discrimination on aliens who are ineligible for citizenship and stripping their right to have an occupation as a farmer. Also they made a distinction between ownership and leasing.
Decision
thumb|The Taft Court
First of all, the U.S. Supreme Court didn’t admit the violation of due process and equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Acknowledging state’s power of discretion, they differentiate the right of leasing land and the right of getting occupation saying the “quality and allegiance of those who own, occupy, and use the farm lands within its borders are matters of highest importance and affect the safety and power of the state itself.” 
Also addressing the Alien Land Law of Washington, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the statute that aliens who are not eligible for citizenship, or didn’t declare the intention to be naturalized “in good faith,” don’t have a right to own or lease the land, which implies there is no breach on due process and equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
When it comes to claim of conflict with the Treaty between the United States and Japan, the Supreme Court claimed the right to "carry on trade" or "to own or lease and occupy houses, manufactories, warehouses and shops," or "to lease land for residential and commercial purposes," or "to do anything incident to or necessary for trade" don't imply the right to own or lease the land for “agricultural purposes.”

From "Terrett v. Taylor" ==> """
Terrett v. Taylor, 13 U.S. (9 Cranch) 43 (1815), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States.
 Background 
The Church of England was the established church in the colony of Virginia. It was "perhaps the most rigid and exclusive establishment of religion in America" from the colony's founding until just prior to the American Revolutionary War, according to the scholar Michael W. McConnell. Terrett involved what were known as glebe lands—church lands that were rented out to individual tenants to provide revenue for the local parish minister. These lands had mostly been granted to the church by royal charter, although a few were donations. Laws passed in 1776 and 1784 affirmed that the lands belonged to the church (which became known as the Protestant Episcopal Church after the Revolution broke out). Two years later, disestablishmentarian trends led the legislature to repeal the 1784 statute, which had incorporated the church (over objections from Presbyterians and Baptists) and replace it with a provision allowing all religious groups to maintain their property and to appoint trustees to manage it. Still, non-Episcopalians viewed the situation as unfair: the Episcopal Church retained its substantial amounts of land, but other groups (which had formerly not been allowed to own property at all) had no such holdings. The fact that the shrinking Episcopal Church was associated with the British Crown and the Federalist aristocracy worsened resentments.
Jeffersonians obtained a majority in the Virginia legislature midway through the Adams administration. Believing that the Episcopalians' retention of land violated the separation of church and state, in 1798 they repealed both the 1776 law and the 1786 law on the grounds that they were "inconsistent with the principles of the constitution and of religious freedom". In 1801, the legislature passed a law claiming title to all glebe lands that were not being actively used for religious purposes; the lands were to be sold, with the proceeds to be spent to help the parish poor. Opponents of the law wished to challenge it in federal court (where most judges were Federalists) rather than in Virginia state court, so the lawsuit was filed by the vestrymen of a church in Alexandria, which had recently been ceded to the federal government to form the District of Columbia. They sued the overseers of the poor of Fairfax County, Virginia, in the federal circuit court in D.C. to quiet their title to the glebe lands. The vestrymen prevailed at trial, and the case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.
 Decision 
In an opinion by Justice Joseph Story delivered on February 17, 1815, the Court held that Virginia could not confiscate the Episcopal lands. He wrote:
In referencing "the spirit and the letter" of the Constitution, Story did not indicate which particular constitutional provision had been violated. The legal historian G. Edward White lists three possibilities: the Takings Clause, the Contract Clause, and a provision of Article I, Section 8 giving Congress sole authority over the District of Columbia. He dismisses the Takings Clause because it applied only to the federal government, and he infers from other language in Story's opinion that Article I, Section 8, was not intended either. Some evidence from Story's later writings suggests that the justice was referring to the Contract Clause, but the land at issue had been purchased directly from an individual, making it unclear what contract had been impaired. The historian Leonard Levy describes Terrett as "the first case and one of the very few in which the Supreme Court relied exclusively on upon the concept of a higher law as the sole basis for holding a state act unconstitutional", although the historian David Garrow suggests that Story's reference to "natural justice" was "meant only to express his moral outrage along the way to his clear conclusion" that the law violated the Constitution.
Justices Johnson and Todd were not present when the case was decided. Story commented that the decision was that of a "majority of the Court", which in White's view indicates that at least one of the other justices may have disagreed.

From "Terry v. Adams" ==> """
Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461 (1953), was a United States Supreme Court decision that held white-only pre-primary elections to be unconstitutional. It was the last in a series of court cases addressing the system of white primaries designed to disenfranchise African-American voters in the southern United States.
In the first of these cases, Nixon v. Herndon (1927), Nixon sued for damages under federal civil rights laws after being denied a ballot in a Democratic party primary election on the basis of race. The Court found in his favor on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law, while not discussing his Fifteenth Amendment claim. After Texas amended its statute to authorize the political party's state executive committee to set voting qualifications, Nixon sued again; in Nixon v. Condon (1932), the Court again found in his favor on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment. Following this decision, the Democratic Party's state convention instituted a rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in Grovey v. Townsend (1935), distinguishing the discrimination by a private organization from that of the state in the previous primary cases.
The Court reversed course, however, with Smith v. Allwright (1944), another of the Texas primary cases. In United States v. Classic (1941), the Court had ruled that primary elections were an essential part of the electoral process, opening Grovey to review. Under this reasoning, the Court found that denying non-white voters a ballot in primary elections was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment, overturning Grovey.
Terry v. Adams formed the last of these cases. The petitioners, qualified black voters in Fort Bend County including John Terry, Charlie Roberts, Willie Melton, and Arizona Fleming, sued an organization known as the Jaybird Democratic Association, which since 1889 had organized white-only pre-elections for county offices; the winners of these pre-elections invariably won the subsequent official elections. The Court found for the plaintiffs but reached no majority opinion. Justices Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, and Harold H. Burton found that an election that effectively excluded black voters violated the Fifteenth Amendment, while Tom C. Clark, Stanley F. Reed, and Robert H. Jackson found in a concurring opinion that the Jaybirds effectively formed an auxiliary of the Democratic Party, bringing the case within the scope of Smith v. Allwright. Justice Sherman Minton dissented.

From "Terry v. Ohio" ==> """
Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in which the Court ruled that it is constitutional for American police to "stop and frisk" a person they reasonably suspect to be armed and involved in a crime. Specifically, the decision held that a police officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures when questioning someone even though the officer lacks probable cause to arrest the person, so long as the police officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime. The Court also ruled that the police officer may perform a quick surface search of the person's outer clothing for weapons if they have reasonable suspicion that the person stopped is "armed and presently dangerous." This reasonable suspicion must be based on "specific and articulable facts," and not merely upon an officer's hunch. 
This permitted police action has subsequently been referred to in short as a "stop and frisk", "stop, question, and frisk," or simply a "Terry stop." The Terry standard was later extended to temporary detentions of persons in vehicles, known as traffic stops; see Terry stop for a summary of subsequent jurisprudence. The rationale behind the Supreme Court decision revolves around the notion that, as the opinion argues, "the exclusionary rule has its limitations." According to the Court, the meaning of the rule is to protect persons from unreasonable searches and seizures aimed at gathering evidence, not searches and seizures for other purposes (like prevention of crime or personal protection of police officers).
Background
Legal history
"Stop-and-frisk" is a police practice where a police officer stops a person suspected of involvement in a crime, briefly searches their clothing for weapons, and then questions them, all without requiring the person's consent and without enough grounds to arrest them. Historically, all major American police forces routinely employed the stop-and-frisk practice.  It was historically viewed as a "low visibility" police procedure and was "largely ignored by commentators and dealt with ambiguously by most courts.", quoting . 
In the early 1960s, several major changes in American criminal law raised the issue's importance. First, in its 1961 decision Mapp v. Ohio, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the exclusionary rule—which prevents the government from using evidence in criminal prosecutions if it were illegally obtained—applies to the U.S. states as well as the federal government. Then, in 1966, the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona that the Fifth Amendment requires courts to suppress confessions that law enforcement obtains without first giving certain specific legal warnings. Stop-and-frisk quickly became a popular topic for law review articles. Several cases forced state supreme courts to address the practice more directly, such as the Supreme Court of California's 1963 decision in People v. Mickelson.People v. Mickelson, 59 Cal. 2d 448, 380 P.2d 658 (1963). Finally, in 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the issue in Terry.
Case background
On October 31, 1963, police officer Martin McFadden was on duty in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, when he noticed two men standing on a street corner. One of the men, John W. Terry, walked down the street, looked through a certain store window, then continued on before turning around and returning to where he started, stopping on his way back to look in the store window again. The other man, Richard Chilton, repeated Terry's movements. McFadden watched the pair repeat this routine about a dozen times. A third man then joined Terry and Chilton and the three walked up the street together toward the store. McFadden suspected that the men had been "casing" the store in preparation for robbing it, so he followed and confronted them. He asked the men's names, but they gave noncommittal mumbling answers. McFadden then grabbed Terry and Chilton, spun them around, patted down their exterior clothing, and discovered that they both had pistols in their jacket pockets.
McFadden arrested Terry and Chilton, and they were charged with illegally carrying concealed weapons. Both men were tried in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. At Terry's trial, his lawyer filed a motion to suppress the evidence of the discovered pistol. Terry's lawyer argued that the "frisk" had been a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and that the pistol McFadden discovered during the frisk should therefore be excluded from evidence under the exclusionary rule. The trial judge denied his motion on the basis that the "stop-and-frisk" was generally presumed legal, and Terry was convicted. He appealed to the  Ohio District Court of Appeals, which affirmed his conviction, then appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio, which dismissed his appeal. He then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear his case and granted certiorari.
Supreme Court decision
On June 10, 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an 8–1 decision against Terry that upheld the constitutionality of the "stop-and-frisk" procedure as long as the police officer performing it has a "reasonable suspicion" that the targeted person is about to commit a crime, has committed a crime, or is committing a crime, and may be "armed and presently dangerous".
Opinion of the Court
thumb|upright=1.0|right|Chief Justice Earl Warren, the author of the majority opinion in Terry
Eight justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by Chief Justice  Earl Warren. The Court began by accepting Terry's arguments, which Ohio had disputed, that policeman McFadden's stopping, questioning, and frisking of Terry and Chilton constituted actual "searches" and "seizures" under the Fourth Amendment. But the Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment "searches" and "seizures" that occurred during a "stop-and-frisk" were not "unreasonable" under the Amendment's first clause. Both the initial "stop" and the subsequent "frisk" were so "limited" and "brief" that a lesser justification sufficed, rather than requiring the police to have probable cause beforehand. 
Reasoning that police officers' need to protect themselves outweighed the limited intrusions involved, the Court ruled that officers could "stop" a person if they had "reasonable suspicion" that criminal activity was afoot, and could then "frisk" the person who was stopped if they had "reasonable suspicion" that the person was "armed and presently dangerous." Neither intrusion required that police have the higher level of "probable cause" that would be needed to arrest or to conduct a full search. The Court defined this new, lesser standard of "reasonable suspicion" as being less than "probable cause" but more than just a hunch, stating that "the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant [the] intrusion." Terry, 392 U.S. at 21, quoted in part in .
The Court held that this "reasonable suspicion" standard must apply to both the initial stop and the frisk. First, it said that a police officer must have reasonable suspicion to stop a suspect in the first place. Second, it held that an officer could then "frisk" a stopped suspect if he or she had reasonable suspicion that the suspect was armed and dangerous, or if, in the officer's experience, the suspected criminal activity was of a type that was "likely" to involve weapons. The officer's "frisk" could only be for the sole purpose of ensuring the suspect was not armed, and so had to be limited to a pat-down of the suspect's outer clothing. 
The Court then applied these legal principles to McFadden's actions with Terry and found that they comported with the "reasonable suspicion" standard. McFadden had years of experience as a policeman and was able to articulate the observations that led him to suspect that Terry and the other men were preparing to rob the store. Since McFadden reasonably suspected that the men were preparing for armed robbery, he reasonably suspected that Terry was armed, and so his frisk of Terry's clothing was permissible and did not violate Terry's Fourth Amendment rights. 
The Court ended its opinion by framing the issue very narrowly, saying the question it was answering was "whether it is always unreasonable for a policeman to seize a person and subject him to a limited search for weapons unless there is probable cause for an arrest." In answer to this limited question, the Court said it was not. It ruled that when an American policeman observes "unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous", it is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment for the policeman to conduct a "stop-and-frisk" of the people he suspects.
 Concurring opinion of Justice White 
Justice White joined the opinion of the Court but suggested that
There is nothing in the Constitution which prevents a policeman from addressing questions to anyone on the streets. Absent special circumstances, the person approached may not be detained or frisked but may refuse to cooperate and go on his way. However, given the proper circumstances, such as those in this case, it seems to me the person may be briefly detained against his will while pertinent questions are directed to him. Of course, the person stopped is not obliged to answer, answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest, although it may alert the officer to the need for continued observation.Terry, 392 U.S. at 34.
With regard to the lack of obligation to respond when detained under circumstances of Terry, this opinion came to be regarded as persuasive authority in some jurisdictions, and the Court cited these remarks in dicta in Berkemer v. McCarty, , at 439. However, in Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, , the Court held that neither of these remarks was controlling in a situation where a state law required a detained person to identify himself. 
 Dissenting opinion of Justice Douglas
Justice William O. Douglas strongly disagreed with permitting a stop and search absent probable cause:
We hold today that the police have greater authority to make a 'seizure' and conduct a 'search' than a judge has to authorize such action. We have said precisely the opposite over and over again.Terry, 392 U.S. at 37.
To give the police greater power than a magistrate is to take a long step down the totalitarian path. Perhaps such a step is desirable to cope with modern forms of lawlessness. But if it is taken, it should be the deliberate choice of the people through a constitutional amendment.Terry, 392 U.S. at 38.
Later criticism
Terry was criticized in 1997 for inaccurately summarizing the facts of the case itself. It was also criticized for "fail[ing] to strike a meaningful Fourth Amendment balance between effective law enforcement and individual freedom."
Subsequent jurisprudence
Terry set precedent for a wide assortment of Fourth Amendment cases. The cases range from street stop-and-frisks to traffic stops in which pat-down searches could be conducted on the driver or passengers.  In Michigan v. Long,Michigan, 463 U.S. 1032 (1983). the Supreme Court ruled that car compartments could be constitutionally searched if an officer had reasonable suspicion that the suspect is armed and dangerous. Thus the compartments are viewed as an extension of the suspect's person. This is known as "frisking the lunge area," as an officer may protect himself by searching any areas from which the suspect could grab a weapon.
The Terry doctrine was markedly extended in the 2004 case of Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, , in which the Supreme Court held that a state law requiring the suspect to identify himself during a Terry stop did not necessarily violate the Fourth Amendment prohibitions of unreasonable searches and seizures or the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination (although potentially could if the citizen in question reasonably believed that such identification could be used to incriminate). The Court did not legalize this process in all states but instead left it up to the states to decide whether they would pass such laws. So far 24 states have passed such laws.
The Court most recently cited Terry v. Ohio in Arizona v. Johnson. In that 2009 case, the Court ruled 9–0 in favor of further expanding Terry, granting police the ability to frisk an individual in a stopped vehicle if there is reasonable suspicion to believe the individual is armed and dangerous. This fulfills only the second prong of Terry (the first prong—reasonable suspicion that a crime has, is, or will be committed—is fulfilled by whatever traffic violation prompted the pull-over). According to Whren v. United States, any traffic violation, no matter how small, is a legitimate basis for a traffic stop.
In Heien v. North Carolina, on an 8–1 decision in December 2014, the Supreme Court of the United States expanded the reasonable suspicion factor of the Terry stop to cover a police officer's reasonable mistake of law that gives rise to "reasonable suspicion" that justifies a traffic stop under the Fourth Amendment.SCOTUSblogOyez, 2018

From "Terry v. United States" ==> """
Terry v. United States, 593 U.S. ___ (2021), was a United States Supreme Court case dealing with retroactive changes to prison sentences for drug-possession crimes related to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, its retroactive nature established by the First Step Act of 2018. In a unanimous judgement, the Court ruled that while the First Step Act does allow for retroactive considerations of sentence reductions for drug-possession crimes prior to 2010, this only covers those that were sentenced under minimum sentencing requirements.
Background
Prior to 2010, the United States had strict federal laws related to drug possession under , which established a three-tier penalty system depending on the amount and type of drug, a response due to the crack epidemic of the 1980s. For crack cocaine, tier 1 crimes carried a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence for possessing more than , tier 2 crimes carried a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for more than , and tier 3 crimes did not have any mandatory sentence for amounts less than 5 g. Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010 which altered the possession levels for crack cocaine to higher levels as to bring these in line with the possession levels established for powder cocaine. For example, the tier 2 possession level was increased to  of crack cocaine. Later, in 2018, the First Step Act was passed that, among other provisions, allowed those sentenced on drug-possession charges prior to the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act's altered levels to seek resentencing.
Tarahrick Terry had been charged with possession of  of crack cocaine in 2008, treated as a tier 3 violation, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Terry sought a resentencing hearing after the passage of the Fair Sentencing Act but was denied by both the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and on appeal at the Eleventh Circuit as his drug possession had been determined to be an act of recidivism. Following passage of the First Step Act, Terry again sought a resentencing hearing, arguing his possession fell under the retroactive considerations of this new act. Again, both the District Court and Eleventh Circuit ruled against this, stating that Terry's possession charge as a tier 3 act was not a covered crime under the First Step Act.
Supreme Court
Terry petitioned to the Supreme Court, arguing there was a split circuit decision on whether tier 3 possession crimes could be resentenced under the First Step Act. At the time that Terry filed his petition, the United States government under the Donald Trump administration intended to defend its position in alignment with the Eleventh Circuit's decision. The Court granted certiorari on January 9, 2021, a few weeks before Joe Biden took office as president. Normally, once the Court had granted certiorari, the petitioner and respondent file briefs along with amicus curiae from third parties. However, with the change in the administration, the U.S. government did not file any brief, but instead on the brief deadline, filed a letter stated that it no longer intended to defend its position as respondent, believing that Terry's crime was a covered crime under the First Step Act. The Court had planned oral hearings in April 2021, but due to the government effectively dropping out from the case, the case's oral hearings were rescheduled to May 4, 2021, and the Court appointed law professor Adam Mortara to present the respondent arguments as to resolve the split circuit, rather than deem the case moot.
The Court issued its decision on June 14, 2021. The judgement was unanimous, upholding the Eleventh Circuit's decision that Terry's charge was not a covered crime eligible for resentencing under the First Step Act. The majority opinion was written by Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by all but Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote a concurrence joining in judgement and in the opinion in part. Thomas's decision identified that within the First Step Act, the covered cases eligible for resentencing hearings were those that were "a violation of a Federal criminal statute, the statutory penalties for which were modified by [the Fair Sentencing Act]", principally those that carried mandatory minimum sentences and not tier 3 crimes which were not modified by the Fair Sentencing Act.
Sotomayor's concurrence had stressed that the Court's decision was bound by the current language of the First Step Act, and urged Congress to pass a new law that would remedy situations like Terry.

From "Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc." ==> """
Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318 (2015),. is a landmark patent Supreme Court case disputing over the Copaxone patent. The Court held that, when reviewing a district court’s resolution of subsidiary factual matters made in the course of its construction of a patent claim, the Federal Circuit must apply a "clear error," not a de novo, standard of review.
Facts and procedural history
The case originated in the Southern District of New York, where Sandoz sued to invalidate Teva's patent on a drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.  In the Markman hearing, Sandoz argued that a claim was fatally indefinite for failing to identify which of three possible meanings a particular claim term, related to the molecular weight of a component of the drug, should be interpreted to have.  The district court judge held that the claim term was definite, and that a "person of ordinary skill in the art" would interpret the term "molecular weight" to mean the "peak average molecular weight", that is, the weight of the molecule most prevalent in the mixture.  In doing so, the judge relied in part on expert witness testimony.
Sandoz appealed to the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the claim under a 'de novo' standard, decided that the claim term was fatally indefinite, and hence that the patent was invalid.
Teva appealed to the US Supreme Court and won.

From "Texaco Inc. v. Dagher" ==> """
Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U.S. 1 (2006), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving the application of U.S. antitrust law to a joint venture between oil companies to market gasoline to gas stations.  The Court ruled unanimouslyThe vote was 8-0; the ninth justice, Samuel Alito, was confirmed to the Court on January 31, 2006 after it had already heard oral argument on January 10, and so did not participate in the decision. that the joint venture's unified price for the two companies' brands of gasoline was not a price-fixing scheme between competitors in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.  The Court instead considered the joint venture a single entity that made pricing decisions, in which the oil companies participated as cooperative investors.
Facts
Texaco and Shell Oil, historically competitors in the national and international oil and gasoline markets, formed a joint venture in 1998 called "Equilon" to consolidate their operations in the western United States, which ended competition between the two companies in the domestic refining and marketing of gasoline.  Under the joint venture agreement, Texaco and Shell agreed to pool their resources and share the risks of and profits from Equilon's activities.  Equilon's board of directors would comprise representatives of Texaco and Shell Oil, and Equilon gasoline would be sold to gas stations under the original Texaco and Shell Oil brand names. The formation of Equilon was approved by consent decree, subject to certain divestments and other modifications, by the Federal Trade Commission,See In re Shell Oil Co., 125 F.T.C. 769 (1998). as well as by the state attorneys general of California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington.  The consent decrees did not impose any restrictions on the prices Equilon charged.
Judgment
District Court proceedings
After Equilon began to operate, a class of 23,000 Texaco and Shell gas station owners filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that, by unifying gasoline prices under the two brands, petitioners had violated the per se rule against price fixing that the Supreme Court had long recognized under § 1 of the Sherman Act.  The District Court awarded summary judgment to Texaco and Shell Oil.  It determined that the rule of reason governed the plaintiffs' claim, under which only "unreasonable restraints of trade" were prohibited by the Sherman Act.  Because they had eschewed rule of reason analysis, the plaintiffs had failed to raise a triable issue of fact.
Ninth Circuit decision
The Ninth Circuit reversed, ruling that the per se rule against price fixing instead applied, which conclusively presumed that the arrangement was illegal.Dagher v. Saudi Refining, Inc., 369 F.3d 1108 (2004).  Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote the court's opinion, in which Judge Johnnie B. Rawlinson joined.  Judge Ferdinand F. Fernandez filed a separate decision concurring in part and dissenting in part.  The Ninth Circuit reached that decision by applying the ancillary restraints doctrine, which provided an exception from the rule of reason whenever a restraint on trade was not ancillary to the main purpose of an agreement.  The court did not believe the oil companies had explained why the unified pricing for their two brands of gasoline was necessary to further the legitimate goals of the joint venture, and so reversed summary judgment.  Texaco and Shell both petitioned for certiorari to the Supreme Court, which consolidated the petitions and granted certiorari to determine the extent to which the per se rule against price fixing applies to joint ventures.
Supreme Court
Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, in which the other seven participating justices joined in reversing the Ninth Circuit.  Significant to the outcome of the case was the Court's presumption that the joint venture itself was legal, which it based on the prior approval by the FTC and the several states involved.
The Court ruled that the Equilon joint venture pricing decisions were not illegal price-fixing between competitors.  Texaco and Shell did not compete with one another in the relevant market, but instead participated in that market jointly through their investments in Equilon.  The two companies shared in Equilon's profits, and should be regarded as a single entity competing with other sellers in the market, regardless of the decision to market their gasoline under two brands instead of one.
Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's ruling, the Court did not believe that the ancillary restraints doctrine applied because the challenged business practice involved the "core activity" of the joint venture—the pricing of the goods it produced and sold.  Even if the doctrine applied, pricing was certainly integral to a business that produced and sold goods.

From "Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine" ==> """
Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981), is a United States labor law case of the United States Supreme Court.Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, .
Facts
Ms Burdine, a female employee, alleged that the defendant's failure to promote her and subsequent decision to terminate her were premised on illegal gender discrimination.Burdine, 450 U.S. at 251. 
Judgment
Court of Appeals
The Court of Appeals held that the defendant carried the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he had legitimate reasons for the employment decision, and that others promoted and hired were better qualified than the plaintiff.
Supreme Court
In holding that the circuit court misconstrued the defendant's evidentiary burden, the Supreme Court attempted to set out the proper approach. The Court concluded that the ultimate burden of persuasion remained with the plaintiff throughout the trial.Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253; see also 9 J. WIGMORE, EVIDENCE IN TRIALS AT COMMON LAW §§ 2485-2489 (1985) (contending that burden of persuasion never shifts). The Court explained that the defendant's burden was merely an intermediate evidentiary burden requiring the defendant to sustain only the burden of production, never the burden of persuasion.Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253-54. The burden of proof, therefore, never actually shifted from the plaintiff to the defendant but remained with the plaintiff.Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253. Furthermore, the Court specified that to rebut the plaintiff's prima facie case, the defendant must simply set forth the reasons for the plaintiff's rejection.Burdine, 450 U.S. at 257. Specifically, the employer must create a genuine issue as to whether he intended to discriminate.Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254.
Significance
In limiting the defendant's burden merely to producing evidence and placing the entire burden of persuasion on the plaintiff, the Court made it more difficult for the plaintiff to succeed with a disparate treatment claim.See Smalls, The Burden of Proof in Title VII Cases, 25 HOW. L.J. 247, (1982), at 265 (commenting that Burdine approach creates severe evidentiary burden for plaintiff). A defendant could sustain his or her duty to produce evidence simply by articulating a nondiscriminatory justification for the employment decision. Because this burden is so easily met, the plaintiff will almost always be forced to persuade a court that the defendant's reasons are pretexts and not the true reasons for the employment decision.See B. SCHLEI & P. GROSSMAN, EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW 1326 (2d ed. 1983) at 1316-17 (asserting that majority of disparate treatment cases turn on ability of plaintiff to demonstrate that business reason was pretext for actual discriminatory intent). The plaintiff's burden, therefore, is magnified because he will have to proffer convincing evidence analyzing the employer's intent.See Smalls, supra at 265. To illustrate pretext a plaintiff may offer direct or comparative evidence of discriminatory intent.  See Corbett, supra note 8, at 231 (describing alternative methods of proof for deriving pretext). Direct evidence includes discriminatory statements or admissions. Id. Comparative evidence involves showing that the employer's justifications have been applied only to certain protected individuals or that the employer has departed from its normal policies. Id. The plaintiff usually uses statistics to make a comparative showing.  Id. At this last evidentiary stage, the plaintiff's burden of showing pretext merges with his burden of persuading the court that the defendant has a discriminatory motive. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256; cf. Clark v. Huntsville City Bd. of Educ., 717 F.2d 525, 529 (11th Cir. 1983) (holding that Title VII liability requires plaintiff to establish that employer's business justification was mere pretext for discriminatory action and that employer acted with discriminatory intent). Consequently, this higher evidentiary burden has created an increased incentive for plaintiffs to allege discrimination under the disparate impact theory where the employer's intent is not at issue.See Comment, Disparate Impact and Subjective Employment Criteria Under Title VII, 54 U.  CHI. L. REV. 957, 960-62 (1987) (discussing growing importance of disparate impact theory).

From "Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc." ==> """
Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., 576 U.S. 519 (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court analyzed whether disparate impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act.Texas Dept. of Hous. and Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., No. 13-1371, 576 U.S. ___, slip op. at 23 (2015).

Background
The Federal Government provides tax credits for developers who build low income housing.. These credits are administered by designated state agencies, and preference is given for the development of housing in low-income areas.26 U.S.C. §§ 42(d), 42(m). The Inclusive Communities Project is a Texas-based non-profit organization that helps low-income families obtain affordable housing.Inclusive Communities Project, slip op. at 2.

However, Justice Kennedy also held that housing authorities and private developers should have an opportunity to defend against disparate impact claims by stating and explaining "the valid interest served by their policies."Inclusive Communities Project, slip op. at 18; Hancock. Justice Kennedy also cautioned that "a disparate-impact claim that relies on a statistical disparity must fail if the plaintiff cannot point to a defendant’s policy or policies causing that disparity."Inclusive Communities Project, slip op. at 19-20.

From "Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock" ==> """
Texas Monthly v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1 (1989),.  was a case brought before the US Supreme Court in November 1988. The case (initiated by the publishers of Texas Monthly, a well-known general-interest magazine in Texas) was to test the legality of a Texas statute that exempted religious publications from paying state sales tax.
The Court, in a 6–3 decision lacking a majority, overturned an appellate court's decision that the exemption was constitutional and remanded the case.
History
Prior to October 2, 1984, Texas exempted from sales tax "magazine subscriptions running half a year or longer and entered as second class mail." The exemption applied to any subscription regardless of its content.
Beginning on that date, it repealed the exemption (it would later reinstate it in its entirety from October 1, 1987). However, from 1984 to 1987, it maintained an exemption for "periodicals published or distributed by a religious faith consisting entirely of writings promulgating the teaching of the faith, along with books consisting solely of writings sacred to a religious faith."
The publishers of Texas Monthly, a popular and well-known general-interest magazine that did not qualify for the exemption, challenged the exemption by paying over $400,000 in sales taxes for 1985 under protest and filing suit in Travis County District Court to recover the taxes paid. It agreed by striking down the statute as a violation of both the Establishment Clause and the Free Press Clause and ordering the State of Texas to refund the taxes paid and interest.
However, the Third Texas Court of Appeals reversed in a 2-1 decision. It determined that the tax exemption met the tests required under Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971),. and so did not violate the Establishment Clause. In addition, the Court of Appeals determined that the tax exemption did not violate the Free Press Clause, as only a few publications were qualified.
Decision
Brennan's plurality opinion
Justice Brennan, Justice Marshall, and Justice Stevens based their plurality opinion in the Establishment Clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." As had been decided in earlier cases, Congress cannot establish a religion or even pass a law with the purpose of advancing religion in respect to non-religion.
The lack of a sales tax on religious literature was in effect a subsidy to the religious writers. If the religious writers did not pay a tax, then a secular writer would have to. That would in essence force tax payers, religious or not, to pay for a subsidy to religions. They held that had the statute been broader, including charities, for example, it would have been constitutional. Justice Brennan recognized the argument of Texas that taxing the publications may inhibit their ability to function to some extent thereby going against the Free Exercise Clause which states continuing from the above clause "or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." However, Justice Brennan argued that if all American people were required to pay the tax it did not unduly burden religion to pay the tax nor "prohibit" them from exercising as they wished.
White's concurring opinion
Justice White concurred in the judgment but argued that under the Court's prior precedent in Arkansas Writers' Project v. Ragland (1987),. the Texas Law violated the Press Clause by taxing Texas Monthly but exempting other publishers solely on the basis of the religious content of their publications.
Blackmun's concurring opinion
Justice Blackmun concurred in the judgment and wrote an opinion, joined by Justice O'Connor, disagreeing with both the plurality and the dissenting opinions. He argued that the opinion does not recognize enough the Free Exercise Clause, and the dissent does not recognize the Establishment Clause. He argued that to understand the case, both clauses must be seen along with the Press Clause, which states "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech."
When religious writings are given certain perks like a pass on sales tax, the freedom of speech of the other writers is inhibited because they have to pay sales tax. Free speech is not inhibited enough to be an issue and so one must decide where the line is between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause. He argued that had the law been written to include other philosophical literature encouraging morality, it may have stood, but when it expressly focused on religion the Establishment Clause had been violated: "In this case, by confining the tax exemption exclusively to the sale of religious publications, Texas engaged in preferential support for the communication of religious messages."
Scalia's dissenting opinion
Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Kennedy, refuting the arguments of Justices Brennan and Blackmun. He extensively cited Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York (1970),. where the Court found a New York law allowing religions and other non-profit organizations to not pay property tax. He argued that even though it included non-profit organizations, the Court had ruled specifically in favor of the exemptions for religions stating in Walz: "We find it unnecessary to justify the tax exemption of the social welfare services or 'good works' that some churches perform." He stated that though a tax exemption is similar economically to a subsidy, when discussing the Establishment Clause, they are different as found in Walz.
Also, a line must be drawn between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause but sees more room between them. He argued that just because a law is not necessary for the Free Exercise Clause does not mean that it is unconstitutional on Establishment Clause grounds. He also notes that it passes all three prongs of the Lemon test by not overly entangling the church and state.

From "Texas v. Cobb" ==> """
Texas v. Cobb, 532 U.S. 162 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense-specific and does not always extend to offenses that are closely related to those where the right has been attached.  This decision reaffirmed the Court's holding in McNeil v. Wisconsin (1991) by concluding that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches at the onset of adversarial proceedings.
 Background 
In 1994 Raymond Levi Cobb confessed to a home burglary, but denied involvement in the disappearance of a woman and child from the same home.  Cobb later retained an attorney to represent him for the burglary charge but didn’t have one for the case involving the woman and child.  While Cobb was free on bond in the burglary case, Cobb’s father contacted the police to tell them his son had confessed to killing the woman and child.  The police questioned Cobb, who waived his Miranda rights and confessed to both murders.  He was subsequently charged with both murders.  After his conviction and death sentence, Cobb appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on the grounds that his confession had been obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  Cobb argued the confession should have been suppressed because his right to counsel had been invoked once he had been charged in the burglary case.  The Texas Court of Appeal held that Cobb's confession regarding an uncharged murder offense when he was charged with burglary, was inadmissible.
 Opinion of the Court 
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals's holding was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, which stated that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense-specific, and attaches to charged and sufficiently related uncharged offenses, not necessarily offenses 'factually related'  to those that have actually been charged. Case overview in Oyez
 Subsequent developments 
Critics of the 5–4 decision predicted that the offense-specific rule would endanger suspects’ rights and grant police too much power to carry out interrogations without the presence of counsel.   The majority, in response, pointed to suspects’ abilities to invoke their Miranda rights during interrogations –rights which were waived by Cobb.  The majority opinion also introduced the Blockburger test — which is used in determining double jeopardy — into Sixth Amendment jurisprudence when using its dictates to determine the distinctiveness of the crimes at issue in the case.  Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the majority opinion’s author, saw no reason to make a distinction between the meaning of the term “offense” in the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth. Chief Justice Rehnquist further stated that at the time Cobb confessed to the murders, he had been indicted for burglary [charged offense] but had not been charged in the murders. As defined by Texas law, these crimes are not the same offense under Blockburger. Thus, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel did not bar police from interrogating Cobb regarding the murders [uncharged offense], and his confession was therefore admissible. Cobb's death sentence was later commuted to life in prison after the Supreme Court banned the death penalty for juveniles in Roper v. Simmons (2005), as Cobb was 17 at the time of the murder.
 The Minority 
This differed from the more ambiguous “closely related” test the minority felt was appropriate for Sixth Amendment considerations.  The minority predicted the Blockburger test would prove difficult to administer for police — as it has proven to be for judges and lawyers — and would undermine other decisions where the “closely related” test was used.

From "Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC" ==> """
Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC, 518 U.S. 604 (1996), was a case heard by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Colorado Republican Party challenged the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as to whether the "Party Expenditure Provision" of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) violated the First Amendment right to free speech.. This provision put a limit on the amount of money a national party could spend on a congressional candidate's campaign. The FEC argued that the Committee violated this provision when purchasing a radio advertisement that attacked the likely candidate of the Colorado Democratic Party. The court held that since the expenditures by the Committee were made independently from a specific candidate, they did not violate the campaign contribution limitations established by the FECA, and were protected under the First Amendment.
 Background of the case 
Prior to selecting a candidate for the 1986 senatorial election, the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee purchased radio advertisements attacking Timothy Wirth, the Democratic Party's likely candidate. In response to this, the FEC filed suit against the Committee, alleging that the radio advertisements they had purchased violated "Party Expenditure Provision" of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), which set a limit on how much money a political party could spend on a campaign for a congressional candidate.
The Committee defended themselves by arguing that since the advertisement had not endorsed or advocated for a specific candidate, it was not in violation of the provision. The Committee also filed a counterclaim challenging the Party Expenditure Provision as a whole, with the claim that the provision violated the First Amendment as it applied to advertisements.
The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado held that the party's expenditure for the radio advertisement did not violate the Party Expenditure Provision because it did not advocate for a specific candidate, as restricted under the provision. The decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, and the ruling of the district court was reversed. The Tenth Circuit held that while the radio ad has not advocated for a specific candidate, the expenditure was still coordinated with the campaign, and thus in violation of FECA. In the court's view, the limits imposed on party expenditures served as justifiable infringements of the First Amendment rights of party committees in an effort to preserve the integrity of elections. The case was then taken to the Supreme Court.
In a prior case with similar facts, Buckley v. Valeo,. the Supreme Court found that FECA's limitations on contributions to an election campaign were generally constitutional, but limitations on election expenditures were not. In this case, the Court held that limitations on election expenditures violated the First Amendment by infringing on the right to political expression. Buckley v. Valeo was used as precedent for the Supreme Court's decision when determining the constitutionality of 2 U.S.C. § 441a(d)(3) as applied to a Party's independent campaign expenditure in the case of Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC.
 The Supreme Court's decision 
thumb|The Rehnquist Court (1998)
In a 7-2 plurality decision announced by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the United States Supreme Court held that independent expenditures by political parties made without coordination of a candidate are protected by the First Amendment.
The court also ruled that the advertisement paid for by the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee was an independent expenditure, as it did not advocate for any candidate in particular. As an independent expenditure, the advertisement was found to be not in violation of the Party Expenditure Provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act. Because of this, the Court did not address the constitutionality of the provision as a whole.
Both Justices Kennedy and Thomas wrote opinions that were in concurrence with Justice Breyer, and Justice Stevens dissented.
 Breyer's plurality opinion 
Justice Stephen Breyer wrote an opinion that was joined by Justices O'Connor and Souter. Based on precedent set by Buckley v. Valeo, Breyer believed that some restrictions on expenditures by political parties were constitutional. Even so, he found that the Party Expenditure Provision of the FECA did not apply to an independent expenditure made by a political party without coordination with a candidate. This meant that the independent advertisement paid for by the Colorado Republican Party was not in violation of the Party Expenditure Provision, and was protected by the First Amendment.
We therefore believe that this Court's prior case law controls the outcome here. We do not see how a Constitution that grants to individuals, candidates, and ordinary political committees the right to make unlimited independent expenditures could deny the same right to political parties.Colorado Republican Fed. Campaign Comm. v. FEC, 518 U.S. at 618.
 Kennedy's concurrence 
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote an opinion in concurrence with Breyer, and was joined by Justices Rehnquist and Scalia. Kennedy argued that the FEC could not set a limit on coordinated expenditures by political parties, because such limitations violate parties' right to engage in political speech as protected by the First Amendment. Based on this belief he argued that the Party Expenditure Provision of FECA should be struck down in its entirety as unconstitutional.
 Thomas' concurrence 
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion, that was also joined by Justices Rehnquist and Scalia. Like Kennedy, Thomas also found that the limitations imposed by FECA were unconstitutional. He explained that there are no constitutional differences between expenditures and contributions, and that due to the First Amendment right to engage in political speech, these expenditures could not be limited. Thomas also wrote that by not addressing the validity of the provision, the Court would "inhibit the exercise of legitimate First Amendment activity nationwide."
 Steven's dissent 
Justice John P. Stevens wrote an opinion that dissented with the rest of the justices, and was joined by Justice Ginsburg. Stevens concluded that political party expenditures should always be viewed as coordinated with that party's candidates, as the party exists with the purpose to help their candidates get elected. Stevens' dissent gave three interest of the Government that he felt provided "constitutional predicate" for the limitation a party's expenditures.  First, he felt that such limits serve the interest in avoiding both the appearance and the reality of a corrupt political process.  Second, these restrictions supplement other spending limitations embodied in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which are likewise designed to prevent corruption. And, third, the Government has an important interest in leveling the electoral playing field by constraining the cost of federal campaigns.
 Remand 
After the decision by the Supreme Court, the Committee's broader claim remained that limitations on congressional campaign expenditures by parties are facially unconstitutional and therefore unenforceable, even when the expenditures are made in coordination with a candidate. The case was remanded to the lower courts and the District Court ruled in favor the committee.FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm.,  The decision was appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision.FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 
2001 Supreme Court decision
The Supreme Court revisited the case in 2001,FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., . with the question "Are congressional campaign expenditure limitations on parties facially unconstitutional and thus unenforceable even as to spending coordinated with a candidate?" In a 5–4 decision given by Justice Souter, the Court found that "a party's coordinated expenditures, unlike expenditures truly independent, may be restricted to minimize circumvention of contribution limits."533 U.S. at 465. Justice Souter also wrote "there is little evidence to suggest that coordinated party spending limits adopted by Congress have frustrated the ability of political parties to exercise their First Amendment rights to support their candidates."533 U.S. at 450.
 Subsequent Developments 
This case was cited as precedent in the case of Republican Party of Minnesota v. Pauly, where the court ruled that Minn. Stat. § 10A.01, subd. 10b, is unconstitutional to the extent it refuses to allow for "eleventh hour" independent expenditures by political parties.  The Pauly Court opined that "The Supreme Court in Buckley and Colorado Republican has imposed upon the Government a significant burden to justify, with solid evidence, the need for particular restrictions on political speech."Pauly, 63 F. Supp. 2d at 1019.
It is further cited in 2000 in the case of Wash. State Republican Party v. Public Disclosure Commission,Wash. State Republican Party v. Public Disclosure Comm'n,  141 Wash. 2d 245,  where the Court ruled that advertisements involving issue-oriented political speech is not subject to governmental regulation.  Here, the Supreme Court of Washington cited Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC for the proposition that the government may not limit contributions where there is no risk of corruption.  It further cited Colorado Republican for the proposition that "The independent expression of a political party's views is `core' First Amendment activity no less than is the independent expression of individuals, candidates, or other political committees."

From "Texas v. Johnson" ==> """
Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held, 5–4, that burning the American flag was protected speech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as doing so counts as symbolic speech and political speech.
In the case, activist Gregory Lee Johnson was convicted for burning an American flag during a protest outside the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas, and was fined $2,000 and sentenced to one year in jail in accordance with Texas law. Justice William Brennan wrote for the five-justice majority that Johnson's flag burning was protected under the freedom of speech, and therefore the state could not censor Johnson nor punish him for his actions.
The ruling invalidated prohibitions on desecrating the American flag, which at the time were enforced in 48 of the 50 states. The ruling was unpopular with the general public and lawmakers, with President George H. W. Bush calling flag burning "dead wrong". The ruling was challenged by Congress, who passed the Flag Protection Act later that year, making flag desecration a federal crime. The law's legitimacy was questioned before the Supreme Court, which again affirmed in United States v. Eichman (1990) that flag burning was a protected form of free speech, and overruled the Flag Protection Act as unconstitutional. In the years following the ruling, Congress considered the Flag Desecration Amendment several times, which would amend the Constitution to make flag burning illegal, but has never successfully passed. The issue of flag burning remained controversial decades later, and it is still utilized as a form of protest.
Background
thumb|left|Johnson (right) with attorney Kunstler,  1989
On August 22, 1984, Gregory Lee Johnson, then a member of the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade, participated in a political demonstration during the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, protesting the policies of the Reagan administration. The protestors marched through the streets, chanting political slogans and staging "die-ins" at several corporate buildings to dramatize the effects of nuclear war. Several protestors occasionally stopped to spray-paint walls and knock over potted plants, although Johnson himself took no part in it.Johnson, 491 U.S. at 399. At the Mercantile Bank Building, protestors removed the American flag from the flagpole outside. An unknown protestor handed the flag to Johnson, who hid it under his shirt.
When the protestors reached Dallas City Hall, Johnson poured kerosene on the flag and set it on fire. During the burning of the flag, protestors shouted phrases such as, "America, the red, white, and blue, we spit on you, you stand for plunder, you will go under." No one was injured during the demonstration, though some witnesses to the flag burning felt deeply offended. Johnson was arrested within a half hour of igniting the flag. One spectator, a Korean War veteran named Daniel Walker, tearfully gathered the remains of the flags and buried them in the backyard of his home in Fort Worth.
Johnson was charged with violating the Texas flag desecration statute, which prohibited the vandalism of respected or venerated objects. Johnson was the only individual at the protest to be criminally charged. He was initially indicted on one count of disorderly conduct, but the charge was eventually dropped. On December 13, 1984, a six-person jury found Johnson guilty of flag desecration, and he was subsequently sentenced to one year in jail and fined $2,000. Johnson appealed his conviction to the Fifth Court of Appeals of Texas, but was again found criminally liable. He then appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which overturned his conviction, finding that Johnson's First Amendment rights had been violated. The court found that Johnson's actions were symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment, writing that, "a government cannot mandate by fiat a feeling of unity in its citizens. Therefore that very same government cannot carve out a symbol of unity and prescribe a set of approved messages to be associated with that symbol."Johnson, 755 S.W.2d 92 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988). The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals also affirmed that his actions did not constitute a breach of the peace. 
Texas filed a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, asking them to review the case. In 1988, the Supreme Court granted certiorari.
 Opinion of the Court 
thumb|William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote for the Court's majority.
Oral arguments were held on March 21, 1989. David D. Cole and William Kunstler argued the case on behalf of Gregory Lee Johnson, and Kathi Alyce Drew argued on behalf of the state of Texas. During oral arguments, the state defended its statute on two grounds: first, states had a compelling interest in preserving a venerated national symbol; and second, the state had a compelling interest in preventing breaches of peace. The Supreme Court handed down a 5–4 opinion on June 21, 1989, in favor of Johnson. Justice William Brennan authored a majority opinion which Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun, Antonin Scalia, and Anthony Kennedy joined. Kennedy also authored a separate concurring opinion.
In the majority opinion, Brennan reiterated the Court's long-held recognition that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects non-speech acts as being symbolic speech, writing that the First Amendment's protection on speech "does not end at the spoken or written word". The Court recognized flags as being vessels for symbolic speech in Stromberg v. California (1931), in which the Court overturned the conviction of a youth camp worker who displayed a red flag at the camp.. Brennan also invoked Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), in which the Court recognized the wearing of a black armband as a form of speech, to demonstrate the Court's history of recognizing symbolic actions as protected speech.. The Court would then analyze whether Johnson's actions could be considered symbolic speech, which would allow him to challenge his conviction by invoking the First Amendment.
In Spence v. Washington (1974), the Court rejected "the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea", but acknowledged that conduct may be "sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments."Johnson, 491 U.S. at 404 (citing ). To determine whether a particular act possesses the elements of "speech" required to invoke the First Amendment, the Court asked whether "an intent to convey a particularized message was present, and [whether] the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it."Johnson, 491 U.S. at 404. The Court found, based on Spence, that Johnson's burning of the flag "constituted expressive conduct, permitting him to invoke the First Amendment."Johnson, 491 U.S. at 403. Brennan wrote that the political nature of the flag burning was "both intentional and overwhelmingly apparent",Johnson, 491 U.S. at 406. having coincided with the Republican National Convention. Johnson, syllabus.
The Court rejected that Johnson was liable for a breach of the peace, writing that, "no disturbance of the peace actually occurred or threatened to occur because Johnson burned the flag." Johnson, 491 U.S. at 417. While the state of Texas argued that flag burning is punishable on the basis that it "tends to incite" breaches of the peace, the Court disagreed, finding that flag burning does not necessarily lead to breaches of the peace. Citing Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), Brennan wrote that the state may only punish speech that would incite "imminent lawless action", and rejected that flag burning constituted such.Johnson, 491 U.S. at 409.
 Kennedy's concurrence 
Justice Kennedy filed a concurring opinion with Brennan's majority. In it, Kennedy acknowledged the potentially unpopular nature of the holding, but affirmed that the role of the Supreme Court is to uphold the integrity of the Constitution, even if "sometimes we must make decisions we do not like."Johnson, 491 U.S. at 420 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Kennedy continued:
 Rehnquist's dissent 
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist filed a dissenting opinion with the Court, joined by Justices Byron White and Sandra Day O'Connor. Rehnquist argued that the "unique position" of the flag "justifies a governmental prohibition against flag burning in the way respondent Johnson did here." Johnson, 491 U.S. at 422 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting). Rehnquist discussed the significance of the flag as applied throughout American history, such as during the colonial era, the War of 1812, and the Civil War, writing that burning a symbol of national unification was distinctly separate from other political demonstrations where freedom of speech might protect protestors. Johnson, 491 U.S. at 423 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting). Rehnquist wrote:
Rehnquist argued that the flag held a unique position in American tradition, such as on the gravesites of Armed Forces members, and as such should be held in a unique position in First Amendment case law. Rehnquist invoked several previous rulings by the Court that showed a recognition of the flag as a unique national symbol, including Halter v. Nebraska (1907), in which the Court upheld the constitutionality of a Nebraska statute that made it illegal to use the American flag on commercial merchandise. Rehnquist quoted Justice John Marshall Harlan's majority opinion in writing: "For that flag every true American has not simply an appreciation, but a deep affection."Johnson, 491 U.S. at 429 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting) (citing ). However, the Johnson majority found a lack of evidence in the Constitution that implied that the flag should be held in a position of "uniqueness". Brennan answered this claim directly in writing: "There is, moreover, no indication—either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it—that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone", Johnson, 491 U.S. at 417. concluding that "we decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment." Johnson, 491 U.S. at 418.
Rehnquist further argued that Johnson's burning of the flag did not constitute expressive conduct, writing that flag burning is "no essential part of any exposition of ideas", but rather "the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others."Johnson, 491 U.S. at 432 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting). He opined that the Texas statute was a reasonable restriction only on how Johnson's idea was expressed, leaving Johnson with "a full panoply of other symbols and every conceivable form of verbal expression to express his deep disapproval of national policy."
 Stevens's dissent 
Justice John Paul Stevens also filed a dissenting opinion. Stevens argued for the cultural importance of the flag and all that it stands for, more broadly than just as a symbol of national unity. He wrote of the flag:
Stevens compared public desecration of the flag to posting bulletin boards on the Washington Monument, writing that such behavior "might enlarge the market for free expression, but at a cost I would not pay". He asserted that Johnson was not punished for his opinion, but rather for the way he chose to express it.Johnson, 491 U.S. at 438 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
Subsequent developments
thumb|Protestors burn the American flag during the Ferguson unrest, 2014
 Public reaction 
The ruling was highly unpopular and controversial among Americans, and drew overwhelming criticism from the public. Legal scholar Geoffrey R. Stone remarked that the ruling was "wildly unpopular" with the American people, and Newsweek described a sense of "stunned outrage" across the country. In a nationwide public opinion poll taken shortly after the ruling, 75% of respondents disagreed with the decision, and nearly two-thirds supported the idea of a constitutional amendment to protect the flag. Polls taken by the National Opinion Research Center showed a decline in respondents expressing "a great deal of confidence" in the Court, dropping from 34% before the ruling, to 17% after; however, confidence levels might have been influenced by the Court's ruling in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services two weeks after Johnson.
At a rally to raise support for the Flag Desecration Amendment, Senator Bob Dole () said: "Americans may not know every nuance of Constitutional law. But they knew desecration when they see it. They're demanding action." In a statement to the Senate on July 18, 1989, Senator Strom Thurmond () said that the ruling "opened an emotional hydrant across our country demanding immediate action". On October 4, 1989, Senator Trent Lott () told the Senate that, while visiting constituents in Mississippi, he "heard outrage" in "city after city", and claimed that several people he witnessed were "in tears over the decision".
While initial support for the Flag Desecration Amendment was high among Americans, with a Newsweek poll indicating 71% of Americans agreed with such an idea, public support for the amendment waned by the following month. By late July, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell () reported his constituents were "equally divided" between those who supported a new amendment, and those who supported the Johnson ruling. Public opinion polls by Gallup show a downward trend in respondents supporting the amendment, from 71% in favor in 1989, to 68% in 1990, to 55% in 2005. A 2006 CNN poll showed similar figures, with 56% of respondents in favor, and 40% opposed. A 2006 Pew Research poll reported only 49% of respondents listing a flag burning amendment as "very important".
The issue of flag burning remained controversial decades later. Protestors around the country continue to burn the flag as a form of anti-government protest, including during the Ferguson unrest in 2014, during the George Floyd protests in 2020, and during the abortion protests in 2022.
 Legislative history 
The Court's ruling invalidated laws against desecrating the American flag, which at the time were enforced in every state except Alaska and Wyoming.
On June 22, 1989, one day after the ruling, the 101st Congress of the Senate passed a resolution to express "profound disappointment" in the Court's decision, by a vote of 97-3. On June 27, the House of Representatives passed a resolution expressing "profound concern" with the decision, by a vote of 411-5. President George H. W. Bush was also strongly opposed to the ruling, calling flag burning "dead wrong". Bush asked Congress to supersede Johnson by passing a new constitutional amendment to outlaw flag burning. On June 30, Bush spoke before a crowd at the Iwo Jima Memorial in Washington, D.C. to express his distaste for the Court's decision, urging Congress to act quickly. On September 12, the House of Representatives passed a resolution that came to be known as the Flag Protection Act of 1989, which made it a federal crime to desecrate the flag in any way, including burning it. The bill passed the Senate on October 5, and was enacted into law without Bush's signature.
The law was immediately challenged by Gregory Lee Johnson, who, along with three other protestors, burned the flag on the steps of the Capitol Building the day the law went into effect, on October 30, 1989. All four were charged in violation of the Flag Protection Act, but the charges against Johnson were dropped because he failed to ignite his flag. Johnson decried their refusal to prosecute him as a "miscarriage of justice", stating that he was "outraged". The case against the remaining three protestors was dismissed by federal judges, citing Johnson as grounds, but attorneys appealed the case to the Supreme Court, who granted certiorari on March 31, 1990. In United States v. Eichman (1990), the Court once again upheld that flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment, with the same five justices in Johnson forming the majority. In an opinion also written by Justice Brennan, the Court declared the Flag Protection Act of 1989 unconstitutional, and overruled it.United States v. Eichman, .
Since then, Congress has considered the Flag Desecration Amendment several times, first by the 104th Congress in 1995,"Bill Summary & Status for the 104th Congress", Library of Congress: H.J. Res. 79, S.J. Res. 31. and most recently by the 109th Congress in 2006."Bill Summary & Status for the 109th Congress", Library of Congress: H.J. Res. 10, S.J. Res. 12. The resolution passed the House of Representatives three times: in 1995, in 1999, and in 2005. However, the bill has always been defeated in the Senate. The most recent measure passed the House of Representatives on June 22, 2005, but failed by one vote in the Senate on June 27, 2006. In 2020, interest in the Flag Desecration Amendment was revived when President Donald Trump said during a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma that he believed burning the flag should be punished by one year in jail, and asked the Supreme Court to "reconsider" their rulings in Johnson and Eichman.
On July 20, 2016, Gregory Lee Johnson was again arrested for burning the American flag during the Republican National Convention, which was being held in Cleveland, Ohio. Prosecutors eventually dropped the charges in January 2017, and the city of Cleveland agreed to pay Johnson $225,000 in settlements.

From "Texas v. New Jersey" ==> """
Texas v. New Jersey, 380 U.S. 518 (1965), is a United States Supreme Court decision handed down on February 1, 1965.  Concerning the authority of the state to escheat, or take title to, unclaimed personal property, the Court was petitioned, under its power of original jurisdiction, to adjudicate a disagreement between three states, Texas, New Jersey, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, over which state had the jurisdiction to escheat intangible personal property, such as uncashed checks.  Recognizing the lack of any extant constitutional or statutory formula to decide jurisdiction, the Warren Court accepted the case, assigning a Special Master to compile evidence and recommend a solution that the states could use for similar cases in the future.  Adopting the Special Master's suggestions, the Court, in a decision authored by Justice Hugo Black, ruled that the authority to escheat intangible personal property lay with the state of the creditor's last known address, rather than the state of the debtor's incorporation or headquarters, a formula used in previous cases.
The players
The case for the plaintiff was argued before the court by W. O. Shultz II, the Assistant Attorney General of Texas.  He was joined by Waggoner Carr, Attorney General of Texas.  The three defendants, the state of New Jersey, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the Sun Oil Company, were represented by Charles J. Kehoe, Deputy Attorney General of New Jersey,  joined by Arthur J. Sills, Attorney General of New Jersey, and Theodore I. Botter, First Assistant Attorney General of New Jersey,  Joseph H. Resnick, Assistant Attorney General of Pennsylvania, and Augustus S. Ballard, representing the Sun Oil Company.
Fred M. Burns, Assistant Attorney General of Florida, represented the state as an intervenor, joined by James W. Kynes, Attorney General of Florida, and Jack W. Harnett, Assistant Attorney General. Ralph W. Oman, represented the Life Insurance Association of America as an amicus curiae.
To gather evidence and present a report and recommendations to all parties, the Court appointed the Honorable Walter A. Huxman, former Kansas Governor and U.S. Federal Judge, as Special Master for the case.
Background
The case revolved around the question of what state had the right to escheat, or take title to, unclaimed intangible personal property, and on what grounds.  While common law had for years recognized that tangible property, real or personal, could only be claimed by the state in which the property was located, there had never been a set rule for the escheat of intangible personal property, such as debts.  By 1964, the Sun Oil Co. had on the books of its Texas offices intangible personal property, mainly checks unclaimed or uncashed by creditors, worth $26,461.65.  These payments, which included unclaimed checks for wages and expenses, payments to suppliers or vendors, royalty checks for oil-and-gas producing lands, and payment for fractional mineral interests, dated from 7 to 40 years before the case was presented, and were owed to “approximately 1,730 small creditors” whose last known address was in Texas.
Case history
While the state of Texas argued that “this intangible property should be treated as situated in Texas, so as to permit that State to escheat,” two other areas, the state of New Jersey, where Sun Oil Co. was incorporated, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, where their corporate offices were located, argued for their own right to escheat.  Since the Supreme Court had ruled three years previously, in Western Union Co. v Pennsylvania (1961), that one state had “no power to render a judgment of escheat which would bar...any other State from escheating the same property”, the state of Texas petitioned the court, under Art. III, 2, of the Constitution, which gave the Court original jurisdiction over cases between states, for a definitive declaration of rights on the subject.  Noting that “since the States separately are without constitutional power to provide a rule to settle this interstate controversy and since there is no applicable federal statute,” the Court accepted the case, arguing that it was their responsibility “in the exercise of our original jurisdiction to adopt a rule which will settle the question of which State will be allowed to escheat this intangible property.”
The arguments
The plaintiff, the state of Texas, argued that the State with “the most significant ‘contacts’ with the debt should be allowed exclusive jurisdiction to escheat it,” and that under this test the state of Texas had the best claim to jurisdiction over the unclaimed property.  The plaintiffs also argued that Texas had a superior claim to escheat on the grounds that at least the part of the intangible obligations were “royalties, rents, and mineral proceeds derived from land located in Texas.”  The state of New Jersey countered with the argument that the State with power to escheat was the state that was the domicile of the debtor, in this case New Jersey, where Sun Oil Co. was incorporated.  Pennsylvania, in a similar vein to New Jersey, argued that it was the location of the debtor's “principal offices,” rather than state of incorporation, that had jurisdiction to escheat the property.
The state of Florida, given leave to act as an intervenor due to its claim on intangible property Sun Oil Co. owed to creditors whose last known address was in Florida, argued that the debt was the property of the creditor, not the debtor, and that “fairness among the States requires that the right and power to escheat the debt should be accorded to the State of the creditor's last known address as shown by the debtor's books and records.”
The decision
In a decision authored by Justice Hugo Black, the Court adopted the finding of the Special Master assigned to the case, whose report agreed with the argument put forward by the state of Florida, namely that the power to escheat should reside in the state of the creditor's last known address, rather than any physical address associated with the debtor. Addressing the position of the state of Texas, the Court categorically rejected the “contacts” argument, declaring that “it is simply a phrase suggesting that this Court should examine the circumstances surrounding each particular item of escheatable property on its own peculiar facts and then try to make a difficult, often quite subjective, decision as to which State's claim to those pennies or dollars seems stronger than another's.”  The adoption of such a standard Black wrote “might in the end create so much uncertainty and threaten so much expensive litigation that the States might find that they would lose more in litigation expenses than they might gain in escheats.”
While noting that the plan offered by the state of New Jersey, that power to escheat should reside in the debtor's state of incorporation, had the “obvious virtues of clarity and ease of application,” the Court concluded “that in deciding a question which should be determined primarily on principles of fairness, it would too greatly exalt a minor factor to permit escheat of obligations incurred all over the country by the State in which the debtor happened to incorporate itself.”   Addressing Pennsylvania's argument that jurisdiction resided in the state of the debtor's “principal offices,” Black's decision noted the inherently subjective nature of terms such as “main offices”. “principal offices,” and “principal place of business.”  Arguing that the determination of this locale would require case-by-case examination, the Court rejected the Commonwealth's argument, declaring that “any rule leaving so much for decision on a case-by-case basis should not be adopted unless none is available which is more certain and yet still fair.”
Accepting the logic that the debt in question was the property of the creditor rather than the debtor, the Court adopted the plan offered by the state of Florida, that power to escheat should reside in the state of the creditor's last known address.  “Adoption of such a rule,” Black wrote, “involves a factual issue simple and easy to resolve, and leaves no legal issue to be decided.”  “By using a standard of last known address,” the Court concluded, “rather than technical legal concepts of residence and domicile, administration and application of escheat laws should be simplified.”
To address situations in which there is no last address for the creditor, the Court decided that the property was “subject to escheat by the State of corporate domicile, provided that another State could later escheat upon proof that the last known address of the creditor was within its borders.”  In instances where the state of the creditor's last known address did not provide for escheat by the state, the Court declared that intangible personal property was “subject to the right of the State of the last known address to recover it if and when its law made provision for escheat of such property,” with the provision that the state could retain “the property for itself only until some other State comes forward with proof that it has a superior right to escheat.”
Dissent
In a dissenting opinion Justice Potter Stewart adhered to the rule established in previous cases that the power to escheat lay with the state of the debtor's incorporation.  Noting three previous cases in which this rule had been used, Standard Oil Co. v. New Jersey, 341 U.S. 428; Anderson Nat. Bank v. Luckett, 321 U.S. 233; Security Savings Bank v. California, 263 U.S. 282.  Stewart refused to overturn these precedents, noting that “adherence to settled precedent seems to me far better than giving the property to the State within which is located the one place where we know the creditor is not.”

From "Texas v. New Mexico" ==> """
Texas v. New Mexico, 592 U.S. ___ (2020), is a long-running United States Supreme Court case between the U.S. states of Texas and New Mexico regarding the Pecos River Compact. It was decided on December 14, 2020.
 Background 
In 2014, heavy rainfall brought by Tropical Storm Odile dumped large amounts of water into the Pecos River basin. This resulted in the Brantley Dam along the Pecos River being unable to hold all of the water and it was released downstream. Texas then emptied 40,000 acre-feet of water from its Red Bluff Reservoir to accommodate the flow. New Mexico holds that the unused water counts toward Texas' allotment under the Pecos River Compact; Texas disputes this.

From "Texas v. New Mexico and Colorado" ==> """
Texas v. New Mexico and Colorado, 583 U.S. ___ (2018), was a Supreme Court case argued and decided during the 2017 term of the Supreme Court of the United States. The case involved an interstate dispute regarding New Mexico's compliance with the Rio Grande Compact of 1938, an agreement which established a plan for equitable apportionment of the water in the Rio Grande Basin among the states of Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The Court considered the question of whether the U.S. federal government had a legal right to join litigation against New Mexico; the Court ruled that the federal government was within its rights when it did so.
 Background 
 The Rio Grande Compact 
The interstate agreement that the case centered around, the Rio Grande Compact, arose from multiple concerns regarding apportionment of water during the early 20th century. According to the terms of the Convention Between the United States and Mexico for the Equitable Distribution of the Waters of the Rio Grande for Irrigation Purposes, a treaty that the United States signed with Mexico in 1906, the U.S. must supply Mexico with at least 60,000 acre-feet of water from the Rio Grande each year. As part of its efforts to develop the arid American West through the Newlands Reclamation Act and the Rio Grande Project, the federal government began construction of the Elephant Butte Reservoir in New Mexico to reserve a large amount of water for transference to Mexican officials; the reservoir was completed in 1916 and soon found additional use supplying farmers in New Mexico and Texas with water for irrigation of their crops. However, a lack of regulation regarding water apportionment between the states caused tension between Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, leading them to sign the Rio Grande Compact in March 1938, which committed all three states to equal division of the Rio Grande's water supplies above a point in Fort Quitman, Texas.
 Interstate Conflict 
In early 2014, the state of Texas sued New Mexico, formally accusing it of allowing the water reserves of the Rio Grande to be discreetly channeled away for use within New Mexico and of depriving Texas of its equal share in the river's resources. Asserting that the violation was an injury to the general interests of the United States, the federal government followed suit and filed a complaint against New Mexico the same year, which raised the question of whether the federal government had the legal right to intervene in matters regarding the relevant type of interstate compact. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on October 10, 2017, despite a Special Master's recommendation that the Court reject a hearing of the federal government's complaints on the grounds that the Rio Grande Compact and subsequent federal legislation did not grant the federal government enforcement powers related to the Compact.
 Question presented 
The key question of the case was "May the United States properly intervene in an action involving a dispute over a compact between states?"
 Ruling 
The case was argued before the Supreme Court on January 8, 2018, and decided on March 5 of the same year. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the Court's unanimous opinion, holding that the federal government has the right to join suits in matters related to interstate compacts provided that the compacts at hand are directly related to the operations and obligations of the federal government. The opinion cites the precedent set in Maryland v. Louisiana (1981) that the United States sometimes has the right to intervene in interstate compacts and clarifies this right by adding that, for intervention to be allowed, the dispute must be clearly related to "distinctively federal interests".
 Rationale 
The Court ruled that adherence to the Rio Grande Compact is of direct relevance to the interests of the federal government for three distinct reasons:
 The terms of the Rio Grande Compact are fundamentally linked to the operations of the Rio Grande Project, a federal program.
 The federal government is significantly involved in the functions of the Compact and the coordination of its details.
 The federal government relies upon the proper operation of the Compact in order to fulfill its treaty commitments to the government of Mexico.
The Court also noted that it had been assisted toward its decision by a fourth consideration: the fact that the federal government joined an existing complaint filed by the State of Texas, one of the parties to the Rio Grande Compact, and that Texas had not objected to the federal government's intervention.
Since these first three factors demonstrate the Rio Grande Compact's relation to "distinctively federal interests" and since the fourth demonstrates that federal intervention occurred with the tacit consent of Texas, the case's original petitioner, the Court ruled that the federal government did have the right to intervene and join Texas as a plaintiff against New Mexico.
 Legacy 
Notably, the justices chose not to rule on the issue of whether the federal government has the right to initiate a unique suit regarding proper adherence to interstate compact law. Because of this, the question of whether the federal government can legally intervene in interstate compact law by initiating its own suit (without any existing suits filed by states or without the consent of the states involved in the relevant compact) remains unanswered.
Moreover, the Court chose not to rule on New Mexico's compliance with the Rio Grande Compact during this case, so the issue of water apportionment in the Elephant Butte Reservoir will remain unresolved until such time that the Court chooses to address the question in a future case. However, the Court's subsequent ruling in Florida v. Georgia (2018), a case involving water distribution between the states of Georgia and Florida, established a lower standard of proof in which Florida must only prove "harm" from unequal apportionment for its case to be considered. If the Court continues to apply it for apportionment cases in the future, which is likely according to the assessment of Todd Votteler, the head of Collaborative Water Resolution LLC, this new standard will almost certainly prove advantageous to Texas in its ongoing case against New Mexico.

From "Texas v. Pennsylvania" ==> """
Texas v. Pennsylvania, 592 U.S. ___ (2020), was a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the administration of the 2020 presidential election in certain states, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump.
Filed by Texas State Attorney General Ken Paxton on December 8, 2020, under the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction, Texas v. Pennsylvania alleged that Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin violated the United States Constitution by changing election procedures through non-legislative means – thus violating the Independent state legislature theory. The suit sought to temporarily withhold the certified vote count from these four states prior to the Electoral College vote on December 14. The suit was filed after about 90 lawsuits arising from disputes over the election results filed by Trump and the Republican Party had failed in numerous state and federal courts.
The suit had been drafted by a team of lawyers with ties to the Trump presidential campaign. Paxton agreed to file the case after other state attorneys general declined to do so. The Solicitor General of Texas Kyle D. Hawkins objected to the suit and refused to let his name be added. Paxton hired Lawrence J. Joseph, who had helped draft the suit, as special counsel to assist with the suit.
Within one day of Texas's filing, Trump, over 100 Republican Representatives, and 18 Republican state attorneys general filed motions to support the case. Trump referred to this case as "the big one" of the election-challenging lawsuits. Attorneys general for the defendant states, joined in briefs submitted by their counterparts from twenty other states, two territories, and the District of Columbia, urged the Court to refuse the case, with Pennsylvania's brief calling it a "seditious abuse of the judicial process". Legal experts argued that the case was not likely to be heard and not likely to succeed if it did get heard, and that it was thus a "Hail Mary" action.
The Supreme Court issued orders on December 11, declining to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of the election held by another state.
Background
Several states changed their voting laws prior to the 2020 United States presidential election to make postal voting easier, due to fears that in-person voting would expose people to COVID-19. Numerous legal challenges to voting changes were raised across the country. A number of these cases involved voting regulations that were altered by states' executive branches and not by state legislatures. In Texas v. Pennsylvania, Texas claimed that such alterations violated Article Two of the United States Constitution.
The initial tallies of votes in the election, completed within the week of election day, showed that Joe Biden had won sufficient votes in the Electoral College to secure the presidency over incumbent Donald Trump. Trump and the Republican National Committee (RNC) launched numerous lawsuits against various swing states challenging their vote tallies, particularly in states that had voted for Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election but had turned to Biden in 2020, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia. Most of these cases raised by Trump and the RNC have been dismissed on procedural grounds or rejected on substantive grounds in the courts, and in so being have not affected the projected Electoral College result. PolitiFact noted that the forces behind reversing the election had by this point "lost dozens of election lawsuits."
Before and after the election, Trump stated his expectation that the Supreme Court would determine the outcome. After the election, his legal team sought a path to bring a case before the Court, on which conservative justices—including three appointed by Trump—held a 6–3 majority.Multiple sources:

Procedure
The case was filed on December 8, 2020, directly with the Supreme Court as it holds original jurisdiction over disputes between states. Such cases are infrequent: there were 123 "original jurisdiction" cases from 1789 to 1959. Original jurisdiction cases are immediately docketed pursuant to Rule 17 once the plaintiff submits its motion for leave to file and pays its docket fees. Because the suit requested expedited consideration, the Court set a deadline at 3:00 p.m. on December 10 for the four defendant states to respond. Whereas a typical case submitted through a writ of certiorari requires only four justices to accept to be certified by the Supreme Court, this case would have required five justices.
Texas
The suit was filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. It claimed that Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin violated the Constitution by changing their election procedures to limit the spread of COVID-19. The case was filed on the same day as the "safe harbor" threshold, beyond which Congress must accept certified results from states ahead of the Electoral College's official vote on December 14, 2020. The suit alleged that the four states "ignor[ed] statutory requirements as to how [mail-in ballots] were received, evaluated and counted". It further argued that electoral processes in the four defendant states "suffered from significant and unconstitutional irregularities", and therefore that it was not clear who "legitimately won the 2020 election".
In the lawsuit, Texas alleged that the defendant states, by changing their election processes, violated three clauses of the Constitution: the Electors Clause (ArticleII, Section1, Clause2), the Equal Protection Clause, and the Due Process Clause. In particular, it argued the Constitution requires changes to electoral procedures to be made only by state legislatures, and not by executives such as secretaries of state. Accordingly, it argued, changes to election procedures made by executive action, and not by alterations to state law, rendered election results constitutionally infirm.
Texas argued it had standing to sue to prevent its votes from becoming "diluted". Texas instead alleged that "fraud becomes undetectable" because "unlawful actions of election officials effectively destroy the evidence". Whether "voters committed fraud" was not the "constitutional issue" in this case, according to Texas. Therefore, Texas declared that it did not need to "prove" fraud.
Texas sought relief by requesting the Supreme Court block those four states from voting in the electoral college and extend the deadline by which states must submit their certified vote.
Texas, in its December 11 response to the defendant states, stated "Defendant States do not seriously address grave issues that Texas raises, choosing to hide behind other court venues and decisions in which Texas could not participate and to mischaracterize both the relief that Texas seeks and the justification for that relief." In an interview, Paxton further argued that "the only place we can file is the Supreme Court, and we did what we did appropriately, so to call it 'seditious' is really ridiculous." In response to commentators who said the action was a Hail Mary, Paxton said, "Unless you throw the pass, you can't complete it."

Supporting plaintiff Texas
Attorneys general of seventeen additional states filed a joint brief on December 9 supporting Texas.
On the same day, Trump filed a motion to intervene in his personal capacity, thereby attempting to join the case as a plaintiff. Trump's brief was filed by Chapman University School of Law professor John C. Eastman, who in August 2020 authored an article published in Newsweek questioning Kamala Harris's eligibility for the position of vice president. On social media, the president referred to the case as "the big one". Over 120 Republican members of the House of Representatives filed an amicus in support of the suit, including leader Kevin McCarthy and his deputy Steve Scalise.
106 members of the House initially signed on to the lawsuit in support of the plaintiff. 20 additional members of the House signed on to the lawsuit in support of the plaintiff before it was dismissed.
Later on December 10, attorneys general of six states that had already responded in an amicus brief, Arkansas, Utah, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and South Carolina, petitioned to the Supreme Court to let them join Texas as a plaintiff in the case. This effort was led by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt.

Supporting defendant states
An amicus curiae brief on the side of the defendants was filed by a group of former Republican office holders and officials.
The defendant states responded on December 10, urging the Court to reject the case. Pennsylvania's reply called the suit a "seditious abuse of the judicial process". The states urged that the justices "send a clear and unmistakable signal that such abuse must never be replicated".
Attorneys general of the District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and 20 states filed a brief in support of the defendant states the same day:
 Hector Balderas, New Mexico

Supporting both parties
Although Montana Attorney General Tim Fox participated in the joint brief filed on December 9 supporting Texas, outgoing Montana Governor Steve Bullock filed a separate brief on December 10 in support of the defendants.
Supporting neither party
On December 10, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a motion supporting neither side, but stated that "the [s]tates need this Court to decide, at the earliest available opportunity, the question whether the Electors Clause permits state courts (and state executive officials) to alter the rules by which presidential elections are conducted." Yost also stated Ohio could not support Texas's request for relief because Ohio's position is that state legislatures' power over elections should not be overridden by federal courts. Arizona also filed a brief on jurisdiction but supporting neither party.
Reactions to court filing
Law
The suit was criticized by legal experts and called "outlandish". University of Texas School of Law law professor Stephen I. Vladeck called the suit the "craziest lawsuit filed to purportedly challenge the election". Election law expert Rick Hasen characterized the lawsuit as a "press release masquerading as a lawsuit" and "the dumbest case I've ever seen filed on an emergency basis at the Supreme Court." Edward Foley, director of the election law program at Ohio State University, urged the court to ignore the case and refrain from interfering in the election.
Alan Dershowitz of Harvard Law School described the 11th-hour case a "Hail Mary pass" that was "creative but unlikely to win", because alleging that Texas, instead of its voters, was injured (in order to bypass the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution) is "far-fetched"; he also expressed concern that the case was filed too late.
Senator Ted Cruz, who has served as Solicitor General of Texas and has argued several cases before the Court, accepted Trump's request to argue the case should the Court hear it.
Law professor Noah Feldman characterized the lawsuit as a coup attempt by Republicans to overturn the results of the election.
Legal experts also did not expect the Supreme Court to certify the case, given its reluctance to hear post-election challenges. On the same day as Texas's filing, the Court refused to hear arguments in another post-election challenge, Kelly v. Pennsylvania, without any dissents. The defendants also argued that the legal principle of laches, which may bar an action if it is filed too late, is grounds for dismissing Texas's claim.
Politics
In favor
Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott signaled his support for the case, saying the case "tries to accelerate the process, providing certainty and clarity about the entire election process. The United States of America needs that."
President Trump retweeted several tweets that expressed support for the suit. On December9, he promised to intervene in the suit, and filed a motion to do so the same day, thereby attempting to join the case as a plaintiff. On December 10, he tweeted "the Supreme Court has a chance to save our Country from the greatest Election abuse in the history of the United States." On December 11 he tweeted, "I just want to stop the world from killing itself! ... Now that the Biden Administration will be a scandal plagued mess for years to come, it is much easier for the Supreme Court of the United States to follow the Constitution and do what everybody knows has to be done."
Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both involved in close runoff races in Georgia, voiced support for the suit. In a tweet, Republican Missouri attorney general Eric Schmitt stated his support for the suit, promising to "lead the effort in support of Texas's #SCOTUS filing today". On Twitter, Republican Arkansas attorney general Leslie Rutledge stated she would legally support the motion. Republican Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry also supported the complaint.
In response to an email to every Republican member of the House of Representatives from Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, 125 Republicans joined him to sign an amicus brief supporting the suit. The number represented a clear majority of the Republican caucus in the House. Politico referred to the large number of GOP House members supporting the suit as "jaw-dropping". Republican members of the Senate, on the other hand, were much less likely to speak in favor of the suit, reflecting their different temperaments and political imperatives.
Against
The office of Republican Georgia attorney general Chris Carr also criticized the suit and Paxton. On December8, Carr's spokeswoman said that Paxton was "constitutionally, legally[,] and factually wrong about Georgia". Georgia's deputy secretary of state Jordan Fuchs denounced the suit as "false and irresponsible". Trump warned Carr to not rally other Republican officials in opposition to the suit, and the Republican majority in the Georgia State Senate expressed their approval for the filing.

Democratic Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel criticized the suit, labelling it a "publicity stunt... beneath the dignity" of the Texas attorney general office and saying "[t]he erosion of confidence in our democratic system isn't attributable to the good people of Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia[,] or Pennsylvania but rather to partisan officials, like Mr.Paxton, who place loyalty to a person over loyalty to their country." Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul called the case "genuinely embarrassing". Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro stated that "[t]hese continued attacks on our fair and free election system are beyond meritless, beyond reckless—they are a scheme by the President of the United States and some in the Republican party to disregard the will of the people—and name their own victors."
Attorney and Lincoln Project founder George Conway called the lawsuit the "most insane thing yet". Former Federal Elections Commissioner Hans von Spakovsky said, "By almost any measure, this is the legal equivalent of a Hail Mary pass."
Chip Roy, a Republican Texas congressman and former chief of staff to Texas senator Ted Cruz, characterized the suit as "a dangerous violation of federalism [that] sets a precedent to have one state asking federal courts to police the voting procedures of other states". Republican Texas senator and former Texas Supreme Court justice John Cornyn said he was unable "to understand the legal theory" behind the suit.
Emails from Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody's office revealed that lawyers in the office ridiculed the lawsuit as “batshit insane” and “weird,” and speculated about Paxton's motivations for filing it.
Governor Gary Herbert and Governor-elect Spencer Cox of Utah, both Republicans, denounced Republican Utah state attorney general Sean Reyes's decision to join the amicus brief in support of the lawsuit. Several other states also saw division among Republicans about whether coming out in favor of the suit was wise. The Associated Press wrote that the action "has quickly become a conservative litmus test."
Michael Steele, formerly the chair of the Republican National Committee, called Republican House members' decision to join the suit "an offense to the Constitution" that would "leave[] an indelible stain" on their "political skin".  Jeb Bush opined on the suit: "This is crazy. It will be killed on arrival".
Texas Solicitor General Kyle Hawkins, who normally would speak on behalf of the state in matters before the Supreme Court, was not listed on the suit.
Statistical analysis
The lawsuit included a declaration from Charles Cicchetti, who claimed that his statistical analysis showed that there was a less than one-in-one-quadrillion chance of Biden's having won any of the states in question. Cicchetti's analysis was widely criticized, since it assumed that voters behaved the same in 2020 as they had in 2016 and because it assumed that vote tallying patterns were random over time. In reality, Biden was a different candidate than Hillary Clinton had been in 2016, and the marked shift of early Republican vote counts to later Democratic votes counts had been anticipated well in advance, because several battleground states had forbidden mail-in ballots from being counted earlier; mail-in ballots favored Biden in part because Trump had long attempted to discredit the reliability of mail-in voting.
Writing at PolitiFact, Eric Litke described the analysis as "wildly illogical", citing professors of political science who described the analysis as "ludicrous" and "statistical incompetence", with one wrong assumption being that "votes are all independently and randomly distributed". At The Volokh Conspiracy, David Post described Cicchetti's analysis as "idiotic" because it was based on two blatantly false assumptions: (1) that voters' preferences had not changed since 2016, and (2) that party preferences did not differ between mail-in and in-person voters. Post stated that Paxton's use of Cicchetti's work was "unethical" because Paxton had not mentioned Cicchetti's key assumptions. At The Washington Post, Philip Bump said that the analysis in the lawsuit was "utterly ridiculous", noting that the 2016 results could not be extrapolated to 2020, because Biden was more popular than Clinton and because voters had become more polarized. Bump also wrote that vote-counting was not "homogeneous", with the "blue shift" phenomenon being entirely expected due to mail-in ballots favoring Biden.
Outcome
On December 11, in an unsigned ruling, the court ruled that Texas lacked standing and denied the suit.
The State of Texas's motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections. All other pending motions are dismissed as moot.
Justice Alito, joined by Justice Thomas, disagreed with the ruling denying leave to file a bill of complaint, but did not otherwise find for the plaintiffs. He wrote that the Court is duty-bound to hear the case, referencing Thomas's dissent in Arizona v. California, 589 U. S. ___ (Feb. 24, 2020):
In my view, we do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction... I would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief, and I express no view on any other issue.
Aftermath
thumb|alt=West in 2011|Texan Republican Party chairman Allen West (pictured in 2011) alluded to secession after the court's decision.
After the Court declined to hear the case, Allen West, chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, suggested that "law-abiding states should bond together and form a Union of states that will abide by the constitution". The statement was criticized by Illinois Republican Adam Kinzinger, saying the call for secession was dangerous. The Lincoln Project's George Conway and National Review editor Rich Lowry also criticized West's remarks, stating they were unrepresentative of the "Party of Lincoln".
President Trump harshly criticized the Court's decision, saying "This is a great and disgraceful miscarriage of justice. The people of the United States were cheated, and our Country disgraced. Never even given our day in Court!" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany echoed the notion that the case was never given a chance, saying the justices "hid behind procedure ... There's no way to say it other than they dodged." Paxton, for his part, said the decision was "unfortunate".
The Biden campaign said of the ruling: "The Supreme Court has decisively and speedily rejected the latest of Donald Trump and his allies' attacks on the democratic process. This is no surprise—dozens of judges, election officials from both parties, and Trump's own attorney general have dismissed his baseless attempts to deny that he lost the election."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that "The Court has rightly dismissed out of hand the extreme, unlawful and undemocratic GOP lawsuit to overturn the will of millions of American voters." and admonished that "Republicans must once and for all end their election subversion—immediately." Additionally she reprimanded House members who supported the lawsuit: "The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House.  Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions."
New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell, citing section three of the 14th Amendment, called for Pelosi to not seat Republicans who signed the amicus curiae brief supporting the suit. This proposal would have applied to nearly two-thirds of the Republican representatives of the incoming 117th United States Congress. Pascrell stated, "The text of the 14th Amendment expressly forbids Members of Congress from engaging in rebellion against the United States. Trying to overturn a democratic election and install a dictator seems like a pretty clear example of that."

From "Texas v. White" ==> """
Texas v. White, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 700 (1869), was a case argued before the United States Supreme Court in 1869.Murray p. 149.  Murray writes, "It was one of the more important cases of the Reconstruction period, and it has a continuing long-term effect as a result of its definition of both the legal status of a state and the legal aspects of how all states are related to each other within the Union."  The case involved a claim by the Reconstruction government of Texas that United States bonds owned by Texas since 1850 had been illegally sold by the Confederate state legislature during the American Civil War. The state filed suit directly with the United States Supreme Court, which, under the United States Constitution, retains original jurisdiction on certain cases in which a state is a party.
In accepting original jurisdiction, the court ruled that, legally speaking,  Texas had remained a United States state ever since it first joined the Union, despite its joining the Confederate States of America and its being under military rule at the time of the decision in the case. In deciding the merits of the bond issue, the court further held that the Constitution did not permit states to unilaterally secede from the United States, and that the ordinances of secession, and all the acts of the legislatures within seceding states intended to give effect to such ordinances, were "absolutely null".Murray pp. 155–59.
Background
Secession and bond sales
On February 1, 1861, the Texas secession convention drafted and approved an Ordinance of Secession. This ordinance was subsequently approved by both the state legislature and a statewide referendum. On January 11, 1862, the state legislature approved the creation of a military board to address issues involved in the transition in the shift in loyalty from the United States to the Confederate States.Murray p. 149
Texas had received $10 million in United States bonds in settlement of border claims as a part of the Compromise of 1850. While many of the bonds were sold, there were still some unsold in 1861. Needing money, the legislature authorized the sale of the remaining bonds. Existing state law required the Texas governor to sign his endorsement on any bonds which were sold, but the state feared that the sale price would be depressed if the United States Treasury refused to honor bonds sold by a Confederate state. The legislature therefore repealed the requirement for the governor's endorsement in order to hide the origin of the bonds.Ross pp. 158–159.
Before the bonds were sold, a Texas Unionist notified the Treasury which ran a legal notice in the New York Tribune that it would not honor any bonds from Texas unless they were endorsed by the prewar governor (Sam Houston).Ross p. 159 Despite the warning, 136 bonds were purchased by a brokerage owned by George W. White and John Chiles. Although this sale probably occurred earlier, the written confirmation of the transaction was not executed until January 12, 1865. The bonds were in the meantime resold to several individuals, one or more of whom were able to successfully redeem the bonds through the United States government.Murray p. 150
With the end of the war, President Andrew Johnson appointed a temporary governor, Andrew J. Hamilton, and ordered Texas to create a new state constitution and form a new state government loyal to the Union. James W. Throckmorton was elected governor under this process. Throckmorton was in office for a year before General Philip Sheridan, the military commander of the Military District of the Southwest, dismissed him for being an "impediment to the reconstruction of the State", appointing Elisha M. Pease in his place. Pease was a Republican who had lost to Throckmorton in the election.
As the United States Treasury Department became aware of the situation regarding the bonds, it refused to redeem those bonds sold by White and Chiles. After the state realized that it was no longer in possession of the bonds, it determined that the bonds had been sold illicitly to finance the rebellion against the United States. All three of the governors, in order to regain ownership of the bonds for the state, approved filing a lawsuit under Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution which granted original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in all cases "in which a State shall be a party". The case, filed on February 15, 1867, appeared on the docket as The State of Texas, Compt., v. George W. White, John Chiles, John A. Hardenburg, Samuel Wolf, George W. Stewart, the Branch of the Commercial Bank of Kentucky, Weston F. Birch, Byron Murray, Jr., and Shaw.Murray p. 151
John Chiles, who was being sued along with White, argued that he could not be sued because Texas lacked evidence. He claimed the bond documents were destroyed by soldiers and that there was no way to get them back. White believed therefore, that he should not have to reimburse the state of Texas.
Reconstruction politics
By the time the suit was filed, the radical faction of Republicans in Congress opposed President Johnson's policy in Reconstruction. Radicals opposed the creation of provisional state governments, and moderates were frustrated by a number of lawsuits instigated by provisional southern governors attempting to obstruct congressional reconstruction. Increasingly, Republicans were abandoning Lincoln's position that the states had never left the Union, preferring to treat the South as conquered provinces totally subject to Congressional rule. They hoped that the Supreme Court would reject jurisdiction in the case by claiming that there was no legally recognized government in Texas.Ross pp. 159–160
Democrats, on the other hand, wanted the Court to acknowledge the existence of an official state government in Texas. Such a ruling would have the effect of accepting Texas as fully restored to its place in the Union and render the Military Reconstruction Act unconstitutional. Wall Street was also concerned with the case, opposing any actions that threatened bondholders and investors.Ross p. 160
Arguments
Twelve attorneys represented Texas and the various defendants in the case.  Arguments before the Supreme Court were made over three days on February 5, 8, and 9, 1869. 
State of Texas, Plaintiff 
The complaint filed by Texas claimed ownership of the bonds and requested that the defendants  turn the bonds over to the state.  Texas' attorneys disputed the legitimacy of the Confederate state legislature which had allowed the bonds to be sold. In response to an issue raised by the defendants, Texas differentiated between those acts of the legislature necessary "to preserve the social community from anarchy and to maintain order" (such as marriages and routine criminal and civil matters) and those "designed to promote the Confederacy or that were in violation of the U.S. Constitution".Murray pp. 151–152. Sections in quotes are Murray's rather than the state's.
Texas argued that it was a well established legal principle that if the original transfer to White and Chiles was invalid, then the subsequent transfers were also invalid. Chiles and White might be liable to such purchasers and any purchasers who had successfully redeemed the bonds were liable for a personal judgment in favor of the state for the amount they received.Murray p. 152
Defendants
The attorneys for Chiles first raised the issue of jurisdiction.  They claimed that the section of the Constitution granting the Supreme Court original jurisdiction did not apply. Texas' current situation was not that of a state as contemplated by the Founders, but was that of a territory secured by military conquest. Residents of Texas were subject to military rule and had no representation in Congress and no constitutional rights.
Chiles' attorneys also argued that the sale of the bonds itself, even if conducted by a revolutionary government, was not in violation of the Constitution. Their sale was for the benefit of the people of the state, and the people, simply because they now had a different government, could not decide to invalidate the predecessor government's actions.  They rejected the notion that the people of the state and the state itself were legally separate entities. As long as the people had chosen to act through representatives it was irrelevant who those representatives were.Murray p. 153  
James Mandeville Carlisle, the attorney for Hardenburg, argued that since his client had purchased his bonds on the open market in New York he had no way of knowing about any possible questions concerning the validity of his title. Carlisle further stated that the precedents recognizing that the decisions of the "revolutionary" government would be binding on any subsequent governments were "universally admitted in the public law of nations".
White's attorney, P. Phillips, argued that if the bond sales were invalid, then all actions of the state government during the war were null and void. He stated that "civilized government recognizes the necessity of government at all times". Phillips concluded his presentation by stating that if, in fact, Texas had acted illegally during the war then a subsequent government had no right to appeal that illegality to the Supreme Court.Murray p. 154
Decision
Majority opinion
The court delivered its opinion (with five justices supporting and three dissenting) on April 12, 1869. Chief Justice Salmon Chase, a former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under President Abraham Lincoln, first addressed a procedural issue raised in the original filings claiming that the state lacked the authority to prosecute the case. Chase ruled that the approval by any one of the three governors of the original bill submitted to the court was sufficient to authorize the action.Murray p. 155
Chase wrote that the original Union of the colonies had been made in reaction to very real problems faced by the colonists. The first result of these circumstances was the creation of the Articles of Confederation, which established a perpetual union between these states. The Constitution, when implemented, only strengthened and perfected this relationship.Murray p. 156 Chase wrote:
thumb|right|Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase
The Union of the States never was a purely artificial and arbitrary relation. It began among the Colonies, and grew out of common origin, mutual sympathies, kindred principles, similar interests, and geographical relations. It was confirmed and strengthened by the necessities of war, and received definite form and character and sanction from the Articles of Confederation. By these, the Union was solemnly declared to "be perpetual". And when these Articles were found to be inadequate to the exigencies of the country, the Constitution was ordained "to form a more perfect Union". It is difficult to convey the idea of indissoluble unity more clearly than by these words. What can be indissoluble if a perpetual Union, made more perfect, is not?.
After establishing the origin of the nation, Chase next addressed Texas' relationship to that Union.  He rejected the notion that Texas had merely created a compact with the other states; rather, he said, it had in fact incorporated itself into an existing indissoluble political body. From the decision:
When, therefore, Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation. All the obligations of perpetual union, and all the guaranties of republican government in the Union, attached at once to the State. The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States. There was no place for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the States.
For these reasons, Texas had never been outside the Union and any state actions taken to declare secession or implement the Ordinance of Secession were null and void. The rights of the state itself, as well as the rights of Texans as citizens of the United States, remained unimpaired. From the decision:
Considered therefore as transactions under the Constitution, the ordinance of secession, adopted by the convention and ratified by a majority of the citizens of Texas, and all the acts of her legislature intended to give effect to that ordinance, were absolutely null. They were utterly without operation in law. The obligations of the State, as a member of the Union, and of every citizen of the State, as a citizen of the United States, remained perfect and unimpaired. It certainly follows that the State did not cease to be a State, nor her citizens to be citizens of the Union. If this were otherwise, the State must have become foreign, and her citizens foreigners. The war must have ceased to be a war for the suppression of rebellion, and must have become a war for conquest and subjugation.
However, the state's suspension of the prewar government did require the United States to put down the rebellion and reestablish the proper relationship between Texas and the federal government. These obligations were created by the Constitution in its grant of the power to suppress insurrections and the responsibility to insure for every state a republican form of government.  From the decision:
The authority for the performance of the first had been found in the power to suppress insurrection and carry on war; for the performance of the second, authority was derived from the obligation of the United States to guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form of government. The latter, indeed, in the case of a rebellion which involves the government of a State and for the time excludes the National authority from its limits, seems to be a necessary complement to the former.
Having settled the jurisdiction issue, Chase moved on to the question of who owned title to the bonds. In previous circuit court cases Chase had recognized the validity of legislative decisions intended solely to maintain peace and order within southern society. He had recognized the validity of "marriage licenses, market transactions, and other day-to-day acts legally sanctioned by the Confederate state governments."  However, he clearly treated actions in furtherance of the war effort in a different light.Ross p. 161. The quote is from Ross, not Chase. From the decision:
It is not necessary to attempt any exact definitions within which the acts of such a State government must be treated as valid or invalid. It may be said, perhaps with sufficient accuracy, that acts necessary to peace and good order among citizens, such for example, as acts sanctioning and protecting marriage and the domestic relations, governing the course of descents, regulating the conveyance and transfer of property, real and personal, and providing remedies for injuries to person and estate, and other similar acts, which would be valid if emanating from a lawful government must be regarded in general as valid when proceeding from an actual, though unlawful, government, and that acts in furtherance or support of rebellion against the United States, or intended to defeat the just rights of citizens, and other acts of like nature, must, in general, be regarded as invalid and void.
Chase ruled that the state's relationship with White and Chiles "was therefore treasonable and void". Consequently, he ordered that the current state of Texas retained ownership of the bonds and was entitled either to the return of the bonds or to the payment of a cash equivalent from those who had redeemed the bonds.Murray p. 157
Dissenting opinion
thumb|Associate Justice Robert Grier
Justice Robert Grier wrote a dissent in which he stated that he disagreed "on all points raised and decided" by the majority.  Grier relied on the case Hepburn v. Ellzey (1805) in which Chief Justice John Marshall had defined a state as an entity entitled to representatives in both Congress and the Electoral College.Hepburn v. Ellzey. Justia. U.S. Supreme Court. Retrieved July 16, 2020. Thus, Texas' status had become more analogous to an Indian tribe than to a state. He also believed that the issue of Texas statehood was a matter for congressional rather than judicial determination, and he was "not disposed to join in any essay to prove Texas to be a State of the Union when Congress had decided that she is not". Justice Grier said that Texas's claim that she was not a state during the Civil War was the equivalent of making a "plea of insanity" and asking the court to now overrule all her acts "made during the disease". Justices Noah Swayne and Samuel F. Miller also dissented.Murray pp. 157–58
The dissenting justices rejected the majority opinion for different reasons. Grier, a "doughface" from Pennsylvania, was opposed to Radical Reconstruction and was primarily concerned with the bondholders. He felt that the Treasury lost any control over the bonds immediately after they were issued. Miller and Swayne were more sympathetic than Chase to the radical position. In a separate dissent they agreed with the majority that the bonds had been sold illegally by the secessionist government, but agreed with Grier that the current state of Texas was not a state within the meaning of the Constitution.Ross p. 162
Reaction
thumb|alt=The Chase Court in 1868.|The Chase Court in 1868.
The Court's decision, written by Chase, was criticized by both sides.  Radical Republicans saw this as evidence that Chase was abandoning a cause he had once enthusiastically supported.  Conservatives condemned Chase for a decision that would allow congressional reconstruction to continue.Niven p. 438 
In December, Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, using the Miller–Swayne dissent as his model, introduced legislation to overcome the White decision.  Trumbull's bill stated that "under the Constitution, the judicial power of the United States does not embrace political power, or give to judicial tribunals any authority to question the political departments of the Government on political questions".  In a direct attack on Chase's position the bill stipulated that "it rests with Congress to decide what Government is the established one in a State, and that it is hereby, in accordance with former legislation, declared that no civil State Government exists in Virginia, Mississippi, or Texas." The legislation was defeated by the more conservative members of Congress.Ross pp. 162–63
Aleksandar Pavković and Peter Radan in Creating New States: Theory and Practice of Secession state "'There was no place for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the States' was not surprising. Given that the United States was born from revolution, Chase's words echo what had been stated by many legal scholars and politicians of the day, including Abraham Lincoln and Daniel Webster."Aleksandar Pavković, Peter Radan,  Creating New States: Theory and Practice of Secession, p. 222, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007.

From "Textile Workers v. Darlington Manufacturing Company" ==> """
Textile Workers v. Darlington Manufacturing Company, 380 U.S. 263 (1965), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held:
1. It is not an unfair labor practice for an employer to close his entire business, even if the closing is due to anti-union animus. Pp. 380 U. S. 269-274.
2. Closing part of a business is an unfair labor practice under § 8(a)(3) of the Act if the purpose is to discourage unionism in any of the employer's remaining plants and if the employer may reasonably have foreseen such effect. Pp. 380 U. S. 274-275.
3. If those exercising control over a plant that is being closed for anti-union reasons have an interest in another business, whether or not affiliated with or in the same line of commerce as the closed plant, of sufficient substantiality to promise a benefit from nonunionization of that business, act to close their plant for that purpose, and have a relationship to the other business which makes it probable that its employees will fear closing down if organizational activities are continued, an unfair labor practice has been made out. Pp. 380 U. S. 275-276.
4. Since no findings were made by the Board as to the purpose and effect of the Darlington closing with respect to the employes of the other plants in the Deering Milliken group, the judgments are vacated and the cases remanded to permit such findings to be made. Pp. 380 U. S. 276-277.

From "The Cherokee Tobacco" ==> """
The Cherokee Tobacco Case, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 616 (1870), is a United States court case with implications relating to tribal sovereignty in the United States.
Two Cherokee men, Elias C. Boudinot and Stand Watie, refused to pay taxes on tobacco manufactured in the Cherokee Nation, as required by the Internal Revenue Act 1868.  They argued that they were exempt from paying the taxes by the Cherokee Treaty of 1866.  The Supreme Court decided against the men, stating that a law of Congress can supersede the provisions of a treaty.Prucha, Fransis Paul ed. Documents of United States Indian Policy. University of Nebraska Press: Nebraska 2000
Boudinot and Watie, with the help of attorneys A. Pike, R. W. Johnson, and B.F. Butler,. argued that they were exempt from paying the tax on the tobacco. They used the argument that Article 10 of the Treaty of 1866 with the Cherokee Nation stated,
They used this part because to them it meant that any Cherokee and freed person living in Cherokee Nation had the right to do whatever they wished with their products of their farms and had the right to do so without being taxed.
On the other hand, Amos Akerman, U.S. Attorney General, and Benjamin Bristow, Solicitor General, on behalf of the United States, argued that, the 107th section of the Internal Revenue Act of July 20, 1868, states that,
In other words that under the Internal Revenue Act of 1868, the United States had the right to tax anyone within the countries boundaries as well as within the exterior boundaries.  Also because this act was passed two years after the Cherokee Nation Treaty, it overruled any previous acts.
Justice Swayne wrote the decision in this case for a deeply fractured Court; three justices concurred with Swayne, two dissented and three did not participate.  Swayne indicated the legal direction he was heading by noting at the outset of the opinion that the case involved, “first the question of the intention of Congress, and second, assuming the intention to exist, the question of its power, to tax certain tobacco in the Territory of the Cherokee nation in the face of a prior treaty between that nation and the United States that such tobacco should be exempt from taxation.” His decision yielded one of the most problematic and ambiguous doctrines in Indian law- whether tribes, as preexisting entities, may be included or excluded under the scope of general laws enacted by Congress.  The documentary evidence-including the preexisting political status of tribes, prior Supreme Court precedent, the treaty relationship, and the constitutional clauses acknowledging the distinctive status of tribal polities- clearly support exclusion.  Indian territories, in other words, were not regarded as included in congressional enactments unless the tribe had given its explicit consent and unless they were expressly included in the law.
The Cherokee Tobacco case, however, created a new interpretation- that general congressional acts do apply to tribes unless Congress explicitly excludes them.   Thus, Boudinot and Watie were required to pay the tax on the tobacco.Wilkins, David E., American Indian Sovereignty and the U.S. Supreme Court: the Masking of Justice. University of Texas: Austin 1997   This decision not only affected these two men, but it also affected every decision that gave weight to the idea that Indian Nations were sovereign nations.  With this decision, people would argue that if countries outside the United States, sovereign countries, were not required to pay taxes to the United States then how was a nation within its borders required to pay taxes and still be a sovereign nation.  The holding in this case was a huge blow to the fight for Indian sovereignty.

From "The Schooner Exchange v. M'Faddon" ==> """
The Schooner Exchange v. M'Faddon, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 116 (1812), is a United States Supreme Court case on the jurisdiction of federal courts over a claim against a friendly foreign military vessel visiting an American port. The court interpreted customary international law to determine that there was no jurisdiction.
Background
The schooner Exchange, owned by John McFaddon and William Greetham, sailed from Baltimore, Maryland, on October 27, 1809, for San Sebastián, Spain. On December 30, 1810, the Exchange was seized by order of Napoleon Bonaparte. The Exchange was then armed and commissioned as a French warship, under the name of Balaou. When the vessel later docked in Philadelphia because of storm damage, McFaddon and Greetham filed an action in the United States Court for the District of Pennsylvania to seize the vessel, claiming that it had been taken illegally.  The district court found that it did not have jurisdiction over the dispute. On appeal, the Circuit Court for the District of Pennsylvania reversed the decision of the district court and ordered the district court to proceed to the merits of the case.M'Fadden v. the Exch., 16 F. Cas. 85, 88 (C.C.D. Pa. 1811) rev'd sum nom. The Schooner Exch. v. M'Faddon, 11 U.S. 116, 3 L. Ed. 287 (1812)
Decision
The Supreme Court reversed the circuit court's decision and affirmed the district court's dismissal of the action.
Chief Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court. He noted that by the definition of sovereignty, a state has absolute and exclusive jurisdiction within its own territory but it could also, by implied or express consent, waive jurisdiction.The Schooner Exch. v. M'Faddon, 11 U.S. 116, 136 (1812)  Moreover, Marshall also noted that, under customary international law, jurisdiction was presumed to be waived in a number of situations.
For instance, visiting foreign sovereigns and their diplomatic representatives were generally free from the jurisdiction of domestic courts.The Schooner Exch. v. M'Faddon, 11 U.S. 116, 137 (1812) Similarly, a state granting permission for a foreign army free passage across its territory generally implied a waiver of jurisdiction over that army.The Schooner Exch. v. M'Faddon, 11 U.S. 116, 139 (1812) That custom was established so firmly and necessarily for international relations that it would be wrongful for a country to violate it without prior notice."A nation would justly be considered as violating its faith, although that faith might not be expressly plighted, which should suddenly and without previous notice, exercise its territorial powers in a manner not consonant to the usages and received obligations of the civilized world." The Schooner Exch. v. M'Faddon, 11 U.S. 116, 137 (1812)
Marshall further noted that while the right of free passage by an army usually had to be explicitly granted (likely because such passage inevitably involves physical damage of some sort), by maritime custom, a nation's ports were presumptively open to all friendly ships. While a nation could close its ports to the warships of another country, it would have to issue some form of declaration to do so.  Without such a declaration, a friendly foreign warship could enter a nation's port with its implied consent.The Schooner Exch. v. M'Faddon, 11 U.S. 116, 141 (1812) Marshall further distinguished the difference between private merchant ships and citizens, who are subject to a nation's jurisdiction when they enter its ports with the nation's implied consent, and military ships. Namely, private ships do not carry with them the sovereign status of military ships and the privileges that accompany it.The Schooner Exch. v. M'Faddon, 11 U.S. 116, 144-45 (1812)
Therefore, Marshall concluded that "a principle of public [international] law [is] that national ships of war, entering the port of a friendly power open for their reception, are to be considered as exempted by the consent of that power from its jurisdiction."The Schooner Exch. v. M'Faddon, 11 U.S. 116, 145-46 (1812)
Applying that analysis to the facts at hand, Marshall found that the courts did not have jurisdiction over the case."...the Exchange, being a public armed ship, in the service of a foreign sovereign, with whom the government of the United States is at peace, and having entered an American port open for her reception, on the terms on which ships of war are generally permitted to enter the ports of a friendly power, must be considered as having come into the American territory, under an implied promise, that while necessarily within it, and demeaning herself in a friendly manner, she should be exempt from the jurisdiction of the country." The Schooner Exch. v. M'Faddon, 11 U.S. 116, 146 (1812)
Significance
The decision is regarded as the "first definitive statement of the doctrine of foreign state immunity."Caplan, Lee M. State Immunity, Human Rights, and Jus Cogens: A Critique of the Normative Hierarchy Theory, 97 Am. J. Int'l L. 741, 745 (2003)Ved P. Nanda, David K. Pansius. Litigation of International Disputes in U.S. Courts, §3.2 "Origin of Immunity," 2012. Also, the unwillingness of the Court to find jurisdiction without action by the political branches of government, along with some explicit dicta,"...the sovereign power of the nation is alone competent to avenge wrongs committed by a sovereign, that the questions to which such wrongs give birth are rather questions of policy than of law, [] they are for diplomatic, rather than legal discussion". The Schooner Exch. v. M'Faddon, 11 U.S. 116, 146 (1812) led to a tradition of great deference by the courts to official and individual determinations of immunity by the US State Department.25 A.L.R.3d 322 (Originally published 1969) That system was not revised in favor of judicial interpretations until the passage of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in 1976.

From "Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer" ==> """
Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336 (1976), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that a United States District Court may not decline jurisdiction over a case that has properly been removed to it from state court on the ground that the court is backlogged with other cases, and that a District Court's refusal to hear a case on this ground may be reviewed by a writ of mandamus.
Facts
In 1973, two Kentucky citizens sued an Indiana corporation and one of its employees for damages caused by an automobile accident. The suit was initially filed in Kentucky state court, but because the parties were from different states, the defendants removed the case to a federal court, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, based on diversity jurisdiction. The case was assigned to District Judge H. David Hermansdorfer.
It was undisputed that the federal court had diversity jurisdiction over the action and that it had been properly removed to federal court under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1441 and 1446. However, Judge Hermansdorfer declined to entertain the case. He stated that his court was inundated with cases under the Black Lung Act, and that given the statutory priority accorded to criminal cases and Social Security and Black Lung cases, he would not be able to hear the case in a timely fashion. Finding that plaintiffs' rights would be impaired by a long delay in federal court and that defendants would not be prejudiced by having the case heard in state court, Judge Hermansdorfer remanded the case to state court.
The defendants filed a petition for a writ of mandamus or of prohibition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, directing the District Court to vacate its order and retain the case. The Sixth Circuit dismissed the petition, relying on 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d), which provides that with one inapplicable exception, "[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise."
The defendants then sought review by the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.
Opinion of the Court
Justice Byron R. White wrote the opinion of the Court, which was joined by Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun, and Lewis Powell. The Court first addressed whether section 1447(d) barred review of the District Court's removal order. In concluding that it did not, the Court reasoned that a District Court's power to remand a case derives from 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), which provides that "[i]f at any time before final judgment it appears that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction, the district court shall remand the case."
Here, the District Court never found that this case had been removed to it "improvidently" or "without jurisdiction." Rather, the district court remanded the case to state court based on its "heavy docket," which was a consideration "wholly different from those upon which § 1447(c) permits remand." Reviewing the history and language of the removal statute, the Court concluded that sections 1447(c) and (d) must be considered together, so that a remand order unauthorized under section 1447(c) is not subject to the limitation of review under section 1447(d).
The Court then granted the writ of mandamus sought by the parties, because the District Court was required to entertain the removed action, and there was no other procedural means by which the parties could obtain review of its refusal to do so.
Dissenting opinion
Justice William Rehnquist wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice Potter Stewart. In Rehnquist's view, the Court of Appeals correctly determined that it was without jurisdiction to review the remand order under the express command of Section 1447(d).

From "Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca" ==> """
Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U.S. 124 (1995), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that when an action has been removed from state court to a United States Bankruptcy Court, and the bankruptcy court remands to state court because of a timely-raised defect in removal procedure or lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, the removal statute precludes a United States Court of Appeals from reviewing the order..
 Facts 
Two corporations were parties to a litigation in an Ohio state court. The defendant filed a bankruptcy petition and sought to remove (transfer) the case to the federal Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Court accepted the removal, but on appeal, the District Court reversed, holding that the removal petition had been filed after the statutory deadline.
The debtor filed a further appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, but that court held that it lacked jurisdiction, because the removal statute barred the Court of Appeals from hearing appeals of remand orders.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the dismissal. 
 Opinion of the Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas authored the opinion of a unanimous Court, which affirmed the Sixth Circuit's decision.  He began by observing that "Congress has placed broad restrictions on the power of federal appellate courts to review district court orders remanding removed cases to state court."  In 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d),. Congress provided that orders remanding civil cases to state court are not reviewable on appeal. Although the Court's decision in Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer created an exception to this rule where the remand order was based on a ground not recognized by the removal statute, the exception did not apply here. The fact that the removal in this case was based on the bankruptcy removal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1452,. rather than the general removal statute did not change the result.
 Concurring Opinions 
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a short concurring opinion, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, observing that the precise limits of the rule created in Thermtron were not before the Court in this case.
Justice Ginsburg wrote a separate concurring opinion, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, suggesting that the phrase "on any equitable ground" should be read to mean simply any ground for remand that the Bankruptcy Court or District Court believed was fair. She concluded that both 28 U.S.C. §§ 1447(d) and 1452(b) barred the Court of Appeals from reviewing the District Court's remand order.
 Advocates 
Steven David Cundra argued the cause for the petitioner, Things Remembered, Inc. John C. Weisensell argued the cause for the respondent, Anthony Petrarca.

From "Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division" ==> """
Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division, 450 U.S. 707 (1981), was a caseThomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Sec. Div., . in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that Indiana's denial of unemployment compensation benefits to petitioner violated his First Amendment right to free exercise of religion, under Sherbert v. Verner (1963)..
 Background 
Thomas, a Jehovah's Witness, was initially hired to work in his employer's roll foundry, which fabricated sheet steel for a variety of industrial uses, but when the foundry was closed, he was transferred to a department that fabricated turrets for military tanks. Since all of the employer's remaining departments were engaged directly in the production of weapons, petitioner asked to be laid off. When that request was denied, he quit, asserting that his religious beliefs prevented him from participating in the production of weapons. He was denied unemployment compensation benefits under the Indiana Employment Security Act.
 Prior history 
At an administrative hearing, Thomas testified that he believed that contributing to the production of arms violated his religion, but he could, in good conscience, engage indirectly in the production of materials that might be used ultimately to fabricate arms. The hearing referee found that petitioner had terminated his employment because of his religious convictions but held that petitioner was not entitled to benefits because his voluntary termination was not based upon a "good cause [arising] in connection with [his] work," as required by the Indiana statute.
The Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division affirmed, but the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Indiana statute, as applied, improperly burdened petitioner's right to the free exercise of his religion. The Indiana Supreme Court vacated on petitioner's free exercise right, the burden justified by legitimate state interests.
Decision
The majority held that Indiana's denial of unemployment compensation violated Thomas' right to free exercise of religion.

From "Thompson v. City of Louisville" ==> """
Thompson v. City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199 (1960), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court unanimously held that it is a violation of due process to convict a person of an offense when there is no evidence of his guilt. It is one of the rare instances of the Supreme Court's granting certiorari to review a decision of a court so insignificant (the Police Court of Louisville, Kentucky) that state law does not provide any mechanism for appeals from its judgments.As explained during oral argument, Kentucky provides no appellate review of Police Court cases when the fine is less than $20. The fine here was $10, but it was one of a long series of similar fines. According to counsel for Thompson, as stated in oral argument, this reflected a police vendetta against Thompson for perceived uppitiness.
The case is sometimes referred to as the "Shuffling Sam" case, because the petitioner Sam Thompson was known locally as "Shuffling Sam."See Lewiston Daily Sun, High Court Backs Shufflin' Sam (March 22, 1960). The Court noted, "There is no evidence that anyone else in the cafe objected to petitioner's shuffling his feet in rhythm with the music of the jukebox."362 U.S. at 202. See also [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1596520604 , p. 61.
Associate Justice Hugo Black delivered the opinion of the court. The case was briefed and argued for Thompson by several notable former Supreme Court law clerks.Louis Lusky argued the cause for petitioner. He had been law clerk for United States Supreme Court Justice Harlan F. Stone from 1937 to 1938. With him on the brief were Harold Leventhal and Eugene Gressman. Leventhal was law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justices Harlan F. Stone from 1937 to 1938 and Stanley F. Reed in 1938, and later a federal court of appeals judge. Gressman was law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Frank Murphy from 1943 to 1948, and later was co-author of a leading treatise on Supreme Court practice and procedure, .
Background
Arrest and proceedings in lower court
As stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court, Sam Thompson went into the Liberty End Café in Louisville on a Saturday evening.  Two policemen came into the café and observed Sam "out there on the floor dancing by himself." The officers accosted Thompson and asked him what he was doing, "and he said he was waiting on a bus." The officers then arrested him for loitering, and took him outside. Thompson remonstrated – he "was very argumentative – he argued with us back and forth, and so then we placed a disorderly conduct charge on him." That was the entire record that the prosecution put on at the trial, except for a record showing a total of 54 previous arrests.
The Louisville city ordinance under which petitioner was convicted of loitering reads as follows:
"It shall be unlawful for any person . . . , without visible means of support, or who cannot give a satisfactory account of himself, . . . to sleep, lie, loaf, or trespass in or about any premises, building, or other structure in the City of Louisville, without first having obtained the consent of the owner or controller of said premises, structure, or building; . . ."
Thompson's counsel unsuccessfully sought dismissal of the charges on the ground that a judgment of conviction on this record would deprive Thompson of property and liberty without due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment, in that there was no evidence to support findings of guilt.
Thompson then put in evidence that he was waiting for a bus to his home that was due in an hour or less, that he was a regular customer at the café, and that he was not unwelcome in the café. There was no evidence that "anyone else in the café objected to [Sam's] shuffling his feet in rhythm with the music of the jukebox, or that his conduct was boisterous or offensive to anyone present."
The Police Court found Thompson guilty of both charges and fined him $10 on each charge.
Procedural issues concerning appellate review
Police court fines of less than $20 on a single charge are not appealable or otherwise reviewable in any other Kentucky court. Thompson's counsel therefore asked the police court to stay the judgments so that he might have an opportunity to apply for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the due process contentions he raised. The police court suspended judgment for 24 hours, during which time a longer stay from the Kentucky Circuit Court was sought. That court, after examining the police court's judgment and transcript, granted a stay, concluding that "there appears to be merit" in the contention that "there is no evidence upon which  conviction and sentence by the Police Court could be based."
The city then sought to appeal, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals held that the Circuit Court lacked the power to grant the stay that it had granted, but the Court of Appeals sua sponte granted its own stay, because Thompson "appears to have a real question as to whether he has been denied due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, yet this substantive right cannot be tested unless we grant him a stay of execution because his fines are not appealable and will be satisfied by being served in jail before he can prepare and file his petition for certiorari. Appellee's substantive right of due process is of no avail to him unless this court grants him the ancillary right whereby he may test same in the Supreme Court." The U.S. Supreme Court then granted certiorari.
Opinion of the Court
175px|right|thumb|Justice Hugo Black delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court that it violated due process to convict and punish Shuffling Sam without any evidence of his guilt
The Supreme Court reviewed the evidentiary record and found "no evidence whatever in the record to support these convictions." It then held that it is "a violation of due process to convict and punish a man without evidence of his guilt." The Supreme Court did not state whether the state's action violated procedural or substantive due process, but it is generally considered that the Court found a violation of substantive due process.See Louis H. Pollak, The Supreme Court and the States: Reflections on Boynton v. Virginia, 49  15 (1961).
Subsequent developments
A commentator criticized the Court's opinion as "mak[ing] a deep incursion upon basic principles of federalism" by re-characterizing evidence of conduct that the Court deemed protected activity as "no evidence" of crime.No Evidence To Support a Conviction, 110  1137, 1146 (1962).
According to Court Listener, this case has been cited approximately 16,000 times as of July 2015.

From "Thompson v. Clark" ==> """
Thompson v. Clark, 596 U.S. ___ (2022), was a United States Supreme Court case concerning whether a plaintiff suing for malicious prosecution must show that they were affirmatively exonerated of committing the alleged crime.  The Supreme Court, in a 6–3 opinion authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh held that no such requirement existed and that a plaintiff suing for malicious prosecution in the context of a Fourth Amendment "need only show that his prosecution ended without a conviction."  Justice Samuel Alito dissented from the majority opinion and was joined by Justices Thomas and Gorsuch.  Media coverage of the decision portrayed the Court's ruling as a victory for civil rights lawsuits.
Background
Larry Thompson, a Navy veteran and postal worker, lived with his fiancée and newborn daughter in an apartment in Brooklyn, New York.  When Thompson's daughter was one week old, his sister-in-law called 911 and accused Thompson of sexually abusing the child.  Four police officers were dispatched to Thompson's house to investigate but Thompson refused to let them in without a search warrant.  In response, the four officers forced their way into Thompson's home and attempted to restrain Thompson.  Thompson resisted, was taken into custody for two days, and was subsequently charged with resisting arrest.  Further investigation by law enforcement revealed no signs of child abuse.  Rather than prosecute Thompson for resisting arrest, the prosecution opted to dismiss the charges.  Neither the prosecutor or the judge offered any explanation as to why the charges were dismissed.  
Following the dismissal of his criminal charges, Thompson filed suit against the officers responsible for arresting him under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and alleging, among other things, that he had been maliciously prosecuted in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, which provided the right against unlawful seizures. Thompson's claims were dismissed at the trial level and his appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals was similarly denied as both courts held that, under existing precedent, Thompson was required to show that he had been affirmatively found innocent of committing the underlying crime.  On November 6, 2020, Thompson filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which was granted on March 8, 2021.  During the October 12, 2021, oral argument, the justices posed a series of hypotheticals involving the fictional character of Jean Valjean and the mythological centaur. 
Decision
On April 4, 2022, the Supreme Court released a 6–3 opinion authored by Justice Kavanaugh holding that Thompson was not required to show that he had been affirmatively exonerated of committing the alleged crime and, instead, "need only show that his prosecution ended without a conviction."  After analyzing the historical precedent, the majority opinion concluded that the general rule is that if a criminal proceeding was terminated prior to securing a conviction, the termination could be treated as favorable to the accused.  The majority further held that this conclusion was consistent with the purpose and values of the Fourth Amendment as, otherwise, the Fourth Amendment could be violated with impunity, so long as the prosecutor did not explain why the charge had been dropped.  With this holding pronounced, the Court remanded the case for further proceedings regarding whether Thompson had been "seized" under the Fourth Amendment, whether the officers had probable cause to enter Thompson's home without a warrant, and whether any of the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.
Justice Alito dissented from the majority's holding, arguing that Court had improperly combined precedent from different legal contexts in order to reach its conclusion.  Instead, the dissent argued that Thompson should have pursued alternative constitutional claims, rather than ones under the Fourth Amendment.
Reaction
Immediate media reaction to the Court's decision portrayed the ruling as victory for plaintiffs asserting civil rights claims against law enforcement officers.

Thompson v. Hebdon, 589 U.S. ___ (2019), is a United States Supreme Court decision concerning campaign finance. The Ninth Circuit's decision was vacated and remanded by the Supreme Court.
Background
The Supreme Court was asked to review the Ninth' Circuit's decision upholding Alaska's restrictions on campaign finance after the Cato Institute petitioned to the Supreme Court to reverse the Ninth Circuit.Anchorage judge orders Alaska campaign contribution limit to be reinstated Alaska's limit on campaign contributions was $500 per year to an individual candidate and $1,000 per year to a political group.Alaska’s Campaign Finance Loss a ‘Win’ for Reformers (Corrected)Alaska’s campaign finance laws attract national attention
Decision
The Court issued its decision on November 25, 2019, vacating and remanding the Ninth Circuit's decision for further review..Supreme Court Acts in Campaign Finance and Libel Cases
Reactions
Although the Supreme Court again ruled against campaign finance regulations in this decision, the court avoided making a sweeping decision which would have called into question other donation limits in other states. Therefore, UC Irvine election law professor Richard L. Hasen said that this was the "least bad way" campaign finance reform groups could have lost this case.
According to Jason Torchinsky, a campaign finance lawyer working in one of the GOP's most prominent law firms, the decision shows that a majority of Justices do not agree with low campaign donation limits, but might be hesitant to take on this fight in today's political climate.
Statement by Ginsburg
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a statement respecting the Supreme Court's decision vacating and remanding the ruling of the Ninth Circuit. Ginsburg's statement notes that campaign finance limits regarding political parties in Alaska are more lenient than the limits on contributions to individual donors, unlike the laws in Vermont. Ginsburg expressed concern that Alaska is prone to be influenced excessively by the fossil fuel industry because it is a sparsely populated state that receives much of its revenue from the fossil fuel industry.

From "Thompson v. Keohane" ==> """
Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99 (1995), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) does not apply in custody rulings for Miranda.
 Background 
 Investigation and arrest 
In September 1986, the body of a dead woman was discovered by two hunters in Fairbanks, Alaska.Thompson v. Keohane p. 103 The woman had been stabbed 29 times.Thompson v. Keohane p. 103 To gain assistance identifying the body, the police issued a press release with a description of the woman. Carl Thompson called the police station and identified the body as Dixie Thompson, his former wife.Thompson v. Keohane p. 103 The police asked Thompson to come into the station under the pretense of identifying personal items found with the body, but it was the intention of the police to question Thompson about the murder.Thompson v. Keohane p. 103Habeas Corpus: Mixed Opinions Regarding Deference To State Custodial Determinations p. 607
Thompson came to the police station and was questioned for two hours. Two plainclothes officers performed the interrogation in an interview room. Thompson was not read his Miranda rights and throughout the interrogation he was told that he was free to leave.Thompson v. Keohane p. 103 The police told Thompson that they knew he killed his former wife and eventually Thompson confessed to the murder.Thompson v. Keohane p. 103 Thompson was allowed to leave the police station, but then was arrested shortly thereafter.
 Trial and conviction 
Thompson was charged with first-degree murder and put on trial. During the trial, an attempt was made to suppress Thompson's confession because he was not read his Miranda rights.Thompson v. Keohane p. 105Habeas Corpus: Mixed Opinions Regarding Deference To State Custodial Determinations p. 610 The attempt was denied because the trial court ruled that Thompson was not in police custody and thus the police did not have to read Thompson his Miranda rights.Thompson v. Keohane p. 105 The court concluded that Thompson was not in custody because he came to the police station freely and was told he was free to leave at any time.Thompson v. Keohane p. 105 The prosecution was allowed to play Thompson's tape-recorded confession and the jury convicted Thompson of first-degree murder.Thompson v. Keohane p. 105
 Appeals 
Thompson first attempted to appeal the ruling that he was not in police custody. The Alaska Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the trial court and Alaska Supreme Court decided not to hear the case.Thompson v. Keohane p. 105-106
Thompson then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska. The district court deferred to the judgement of the state courts under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), which states that in most circumstances questions of fact are presumed correct by appeals courts.Thompson v. Keohane p. 106 The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling without publishing an opinion.Thompson v. Keohane p. 106 The Supreme Court decided to hear the case and granted certiorari.
 Opinion of the Court 
Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg authored the opinion for the majority.  It held that 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) does not apply in custody rulings for Miranda.Thompson v.

From "Thompson v. Oklahoma" ==> """
Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815 (1988), was the first case since the moratorium on capital punishment was lifted in the United States in which the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the death sentence of a minor on grounds of "cruel and unusual punishment.". The holding in Thompson was expanded on by Roper v. Simmons (2005), where the Supreme Court extended the "evolving standards" rationale to those under 18 years old..
Background
William Wayne Thompson was a 15-year-old repeat offender from Grady County, Oklahoma. His sister, Vicki, was married to Charles Keene, who was accused of beating Vicki and William. William and three other men (Tony Mann, Richard Jones, and Bobby Glass) then kidnapped Charles on the night of January 23, 1983, in Amber, Oklahoma. Charles attempted to escape, running to neighbor John "Possum" Brown's door. He reportedly knocked on the door and screamed, "Possum, open the door, they're going to kill me". Brown opened the door, only to see four men dragging Keene from the door and beating him. When Brown called the police, the assailants grabbed Keene and fled.
Keene's body was found later in the nearby river, his body split throat to the abdomen. He had multiple bruises and two gunshot wounds, along with a concrete block tied to his legs. William was arrested after Vicki confessed to the police that William said that "he had taken care of him." The three other assailants were convicted of murder and sentenced to death; Richard Jones later had his sentence repealed. Bobby Glass was murdered in prison. After Thompson was arrested he underwent psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he was eligible to stand trial as an adult. He was found responsible for his deeds and convicted by the District Court of Grady County in Chickasha, Oklahoma. He was sentenced to death by the jury.
Appeals
Thompson's attorneys first attempted to appeal the case on the basis of inflammatory photographs used by the prosecution to allegedly provoke the jury. Although the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals found that two of the photographs should have been excluded from the trial, the overwhelming evidence meant that the case was affirmed by the appellate court.Thompson v. State, 1986 OK CR 130, 724 P.2d 780.
Due to Thompson's rapidly approaching execution, his attorneys subsequently filed his case with the Supreme Court, saying that the execution of a juvenile was unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment's "Cruel and Unusual Punishment" clause.
Opinion of the Court
The Court voted 5-3 in favor of Thompson (Justice Kennedy did not participate), holding that Thompson's execution would violate the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. A plurality opinion by Justice Stevens noted the "evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society" as a primary rationale for the decisionThompson, 487 U.S. at 821. - an opinion that was strongly rejected in Justice Scalia's  dissent. The plurality also noted that numerous U.S. jurisdictions and all industrialized Western nations had banned the execution of minors under 16 years of age.Thompson, 487 U.S. at 830-31.
Aftermath
Thompson was later resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. As of 2015, William Wayne Thompson and Tony Mann are still incarcerated. Thompson was granted parole in 2003, but that was later overturned by Oklahoma governor Brad Henry. His sister Vicki is currently campaigning to parole her brother.

From "Thor Power Tool Co. v. Commissioner" ==> """
Thor Power Tool Company v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 522 (1979), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld IRS regulations limiting how taxpayers could write down inventory.  
Thor manufactured equipment using multiple parts that it produced.  It capitalized the costs of these parts when produced.  When it had inventories of parts in excess of production needs, the company's accounting practice was to write down those inventories, taking a loss based on management judgment. 
However, IRS regulations accepted this "lower of cost or market" method for tax purposes only if the taxpayer could demonstrate a reduced market price, or the goods were defective or "subnormal".  It did not permit companies to write down goods simply because they were not selling them.Pratt & Kulsrud, Federal Taxation, 2006, p. 10-33.  .
In court, the company argued that its deduction for loss should be allowed for tax purposes because it was permitted for accounting purposes.  But the Court upheld the IRS regulations, saying, "There is no presumption that an inventory practice conformable to 'generally accepted accounting principles' is valid for tax purposes. Such a presumption is insupportable in light of the statute, this Court's past decisions, and the differing objectives of tax and financial accounting."
Effects
The Thor decision caused publishers and booksellers to be much quicker to destroy stocks of poorly-selling books in order to realize a taxable loss. These books would previously have been kept in stock but written down to reflect the fact that not all of them were expected to sell.

From "Thornburg v. Gingles" ==> """
Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), was a United States Supreme Court case in which a unanimous Court found that "the legacy of official discrimination ... acted in concert with the multimember districting scheme to impair the ability of "cohesive groups of black voters to participate equally in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice."  The ruling resulted in the invalidation of districts in the North Carolina General Assembly and led to more single-member districts in state legislatures.
Background
Legislative history
Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits any jurisdiction from implementing a "voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure ... in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right ... to vote on account of race," color, or language minority status.Voting Rights Act of 1965 § 2;  (formerly 42 U.S.C. § 1973) The Supreme Court has allowed private plaintiffs to sue to enforce this prohibition. In City of Mobile v. Bolden (1980), the Supreme Court held that as originally enacted in 1965, Section 2 simply restated the Fifteenth Amendment and thus prohibited only those voting laws that were intentionally enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose.City of Mobile v. Bolden,  Congress responded by passing an amendment to the Voting Rights Act which President Ronald Reagan signed into law on June 29, 1982.  Congress's amended Section 2 to create a "results" test, which prohibits any voting law that has a discriminatory effect irrespective of whether the law was intentionally enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose. The 1982 amendments provided that the results test does not guarantee protected minorities a right to proportional representation.
When determining whether a jurisdiction's election law violates this general prohibition, courts have relied on factors enumerated in the Senate Judiciary Committee report associated with the 1982 amendments ("Senate Factors"), including:
 The history of official discrimination in the jurisdiction that affects the right to vote;
 The degree to which voting in the jurisdiction is racially polarized;
 The extent of the jurisdiction's use of majority vote requirements, unusually large electoral districts, prohibitions on bullet voting, and other devices that tend to enhance the opportunity for voting discrimination;
 Whether minority candidates are denied access to the jurisdiction's candidate slating processes, if any;
 The extent to which the jurisdiction's minorities are discriminated against in socioeconomic areas, such as education, employment, and health;
 Whether overt or subtle racial appeals in campaigns exist;
 The extent to which minority candidates have won elections;
 The degree that elected officials are unresponsive to the concerns of the minority group; and
 Whether the policy justification for the challenged law is tenuous.
The report indicates not all or a majority of these factors need to exist for an electoral device to result in discrimination, and it also indicates that this list is not exhaustive, allowing courts to consider additional evidence at their discretion.
Section 2 prohibits two types of discrimination: "vote denial", in which a person is denied the opportunity to cast a ballot or to have their vote properly counted, and "vote dilution", in which the strength or effectiveness of a person's vote is diminished. Most Section 2 litigation has concerned vote dilution, especially claims that a jurisdiction's redistricting plan or use of at-large/multimember elections prevents minority voters from casting sufficient votes to elect their preferred candidates. An at-large election can dilute the votes cast by minority voters by allowing a cohesive majority group to win every legislative seat in the jurisdiction. Redistricting plans can be gerrymandered to dilute votes cast by minorities by "packing" high numbers of minority voters into a small number of districts or "cracking" minority groups by placing small numbers of minority voters into a large number of districts.
Procedural history
In July 1981 the North Carolina General Assembly enacted a redistricting plan in response to the 1980 United States Census.Gingles v. Edmisten, 590 F.Supp. 345 (EDNC 1984).  In September 1981 plaintiffs sued North Carolina Attorney General Rufus L. Edmisten, alleging their votes would be submerged by multimember districts in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  Meanwhile, in June 1982 Congress amended the Voting Rights Act, extending Section 5 and substantially revising Section 2.Thomas M. Boyd & Stephen J. Markman, The 1982 Amendments to the Voting Rights Act: A Legislative History, 40 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 1347 (1983).  In January 1984 a special three-judge district court in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina made up of Circuit Judge James Dickson Phillips, Chief District Judge William Earl Britt, and Senior District Judge Franklin Taylor Dupree Jr. agreed, finding that all the challenged districts violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and enjoined holding any elections under the General Assembly's redistricting plan.
North Carolina Attorney General Lacy Thornburg directly appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.  The case was argued on December 4, 1985, with Attorney General Thornburg appearing himself, and the Solicitor General of the United States Charles Fried also appearing, both arguing for reversal. Julius L. Chambers argued for the respondents.https://www.oyez.org/cases/1985/83-1968  Chambers was supported by co-counsels, Lani Guinier, and Leslie Winner.
Opinion of the Court
On June 30, 1986, the last day of the term, the Supreme Court announced its decision, alongside Davis v. Bandemer and Bowers v. Hardwick.  The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed that there were Section 2 violations in all of the statehouse districts except the Durham County, North Carolina multimember district, which a majority reversed.Adam B. Cox and Thomas J. Miles, Judging the Voting Rights Act, 108 Columbia Law Review 1 (2008).  In an opinion by Justice William J. Brennan joined partially by Justices Byron White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun, and John Paul Stevens the Court used the term "vote dilution through submergence" to describe claims that a jurisdiction's use of an at-large/multimember election system or gerrymandered redistricting plan diluted minority votes, and it established a legal framework for assessing such claims under Section 2. Under the Gingles test, plaintiffs must show the existence of three preconditions:
 The racial or language minority group "sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district";
 The minority group is "politically cohesive" (meaning its members tend to vote similarly); and
 The "majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it ... usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate."Thornburg v. Gingles, 
The first precondition is known as the "compactness" requirement and concerns whether a majority-minority district can be created.Katz, Ellen D., co-author. "Documenting Discrimination in Voting: Judicial Findings Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act Since 1982.” M Aisenbrey et al., co-authors. U. Mich. J. L. Reform 39, no. 4 (2006): 643–772. The second and third preconditions are collectively known as the "racially polarized voting" or "racial bloc voting" requirement, and they concern whether the voting patterns of the different racial groups are different from each other. If a plaintiff proves these preconditions exist, then the plaintiff must additionally show, using the remaining Senate Factors and other evidence, that under the "totality of the circumstances", the jurisdiction's redistricting plan or use of at-large or multimember elections diminishes the ability of the minority group to elect candidates of its choice.
Plurality opinion
Justice Brennan goes on, in a section Justice White refused to join, to reject the Solicitor General's argument that a multiple regression analysis is needed to take into account the other socioeconomic factors that might influence voting patterns.Powers, John M. (2014). Statistical Evidence of Racially Polarized Voting in the Obama Elections, and Implications for Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 102 Georgetown Law Journal 881 Archived Version  According to the plurality, race is the determinant, not a mere corollary, of voter behavior.  As illustration Justice Brennan notes that 47.8% of the black population of Halifax County, North Carolina lives in poverty, compared with only 12.6% of whites.  Because race, and only race, is the relevant evidence of polarized voting, the four justices believed the lower court correctly relied only on an ecological regression and bivariate analysis.
Concurrence
Justice White wrote separately to note that he disagreed with Justice Brennan's view that only voters’ race can be relevant evidence of polarized voting.Yut, Scott, Using Candidate Race to Define Minority-Preferred Candidates under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, University of Chicago Legal Forum: Vol. 1995: Iss. 1, Article 22.  For Justice White the race of the candidates also mattered; it would not be racially polarized if white voters elected a black candidate not supported by black voters.  Without Justice White's fifth vote Justice Brennan's section on the relevant evidence only carried the authority of a plurality opinion.
Concurrence in judgment
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., and Justice William Rehnquist concurred in the judgment only.  Justice O’Connor, a former Arizona statehouse legislator, began by noting that Senator Bob Dole, “the architect of the compromise”, had insisted the 1982 amendment explicitly disclaim any right to racially proportional representation.  Nevertheless, Justice O’Connor sees the majority opinion as attempting to create a right to “usual, roughly proportional representation”.  Justice O’Connor next agrees with Justice White that the plurality was wrong to insist the only relevant evidence is the race of the voters.  She writes that the law does not permit “an arbitrary rule against consideration of all evidence considering voting preferences”.
Concurrence in part and dissent in part
Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Marshall and Blackmun, joined the Court in affirming the three judge district court but dissented from reversing the judgment regarding the Durham County multimember district.  Justice Stevens wrote that although Durham County had elected a black candidate in every election since 1972, the multimember district still violates the Voting Rights Act considering “the political realities of the State”.  Furthermore, Justice Stevens felt reversing without a remand was “mystifying” and “also extremely unfair.”
Subsequent developments
Subsequent litigation further defined the contours of "vote dilution through submergence" claims. In Bartlett v. Strickland (2009),Bartlett v. Strickland,  the Supreme Court held that the first Gingles precondition can be satisfied only if a district can be drawn in which the minority group comprises a majority of voting-age citizens. This means that plaintiffs cannot succeed on a submergence claim in jurisdictions where the size of the minority group, despite not being large enough to comprise a majority in a district, is large enough for its members to elect their preferred candidates with the help of "crossover" votes from some members of the majority group.  In contrast, the Supreme Court has not addressed whether different protected minority groups can be aggregated to satisfy the Gingles preconditions as a coalition, and lower courts have split on the issue.
The Supreme Court provided additional guidance on the "totality of the circumstances" test in Johnson v. De Grandy (1994). The Court emphasized that the existence of the three Gingles preconditions may be insufficient to prove liability for vote dilution through submergence if other factors weigh against such a determination, especially in lawsuits challenging redistricting plans. In particular, the Court held that even where the three Gingles preconditions are satisfied, a jurisdiction is unlikely to be liable for vote dilution if its redistricting plan contains a number of majority-minority districts that is proportional to the minority group's population. The decision thus clarified that Section 2 does not require jurisdictions to maximize the number of majority-minority districts. The opinion also distinguished the proportionality of majority-minority districts, which allows minorities to have a proportional opportunity to elect their candidates of choice, from the proportionality of election results, which Section 2 explicitly does not guarantee to minorities.
An issue regarding the third Gingles precondition remains unresolved. In Gingles, the Supreme Court split as to whether plaintiffs must prove that the majority racial group votes as a bloc specifically because its members are motivated to vote based on racial considerations and not other considerations that may overlap with race, such as party affiliation. A plurality of justices said that requiring such proof would violate Congress's intent to make Section 2 a "results" test, but Justice White maintained that the proof was necessary to show that an electoral scheme results in racial discrimination.  Since Gingles, lower courts have split on the issue.
Statisticians have observed that the Court's approach is invalidated by the ecological fallacy.Wildgen, John K.. 1988, Adding Thornburg to the Thicket: The Ecological Fallacy and Parameter Control in Vote Dilution Case, 20 The Urban Lawyer 1. American Bar Association: 155–73. .  Social scientists have found that federal judges vary widely when applying the Gingles preconditions.  Three judge courts made up of all Democratic appointees have ruled in favor of Section 2 liability in 41% of cases, contrasted with 11% under the all Republican appointed panels.
North Carolina would face continued redistricting woes after the 1990 United States Census.  In Shaw v. Reno (1993) the Supreme Court 5-4 struck down North Carolina's attempt to create two majority minority districts.  After hearing the case three more times, in Easley v. Cromartie (2001) the Supreme Court would 5-4 uphold the redistricting because the General Assembly's motivations had been purely political.Robinson O. Everett, Redistricting in North Carolina—A Personal Perspective, 79 North Carolina Law Review 1301–1332 (2001)

Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747 (1986), was a United States Supreme Court case involving a challenge to Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act of 1982..Greenhouse, Linda. Becoming Justice Blackmun. Times Books. 2005. Page 183.
Decision
In 1982, Pennsylvania passed the Abortion Control Act, which imposed a 24 hour waiting period and required that prospective patients be provided with information (such as the probable stage of the patient's pregnancy, the availability of child welfare benefits, and the possibility of receiving child support from the patient's sexual partner) as part of the "informed consent" process prior to all abortion procedures. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists filed suit in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking an injunction to prevent the law from being enforced on constitutional grounds.  The district court denied the plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief and the plaintiffs appealed to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.  The Third Circuit then reversed and enjoined enforcement of the Act.  Pennsylvania then appealed to the Supreme Court which granted review.
In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court affirmed the Third Circuit's decision to enjoin enforcement of the Act. Justice Harry Blackmun, writing for the majority, held that the Act's requirement of providing information to the patient as part of the "informed consent" process "seem[s] to us to be nothing less than an outright attempt to wedge the Commonwealth's message discouraging abortion into the privacy of the informed-consent dialogue between the woman and her physician."
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor distanced herself from the court in dissent, "disput[ing] not only the wisdom but also the legitimacy of the Court's attempt to discredit and pre-empt state abortion regulation regardless of the interests it serves and the impact it has." The 7–2 majority of Roe had now shrunk to 5–4.

From "Thornhill v. Alabama" ==> """
Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88 (1940), is a US labor law case of a United States Supreme Court. It reversed the conviction of the president of a local union for violating an Alabama statute that prohibited only labor picketing. Thornhill was peaceably picketing his employer during an authorized strike when he was arrested and charged. In reaching its decision, Associate Justice Frank Murphy wrote for the Supreme Court that the free speech clause protects speech about the facts and circumstances of a labor dispute. The statute in the case prohibited all labor picketing, but Thornhill added peaceful labor picketing to the area protected by free speech.Ball, Howard. Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior. Oxford University Press. 2006. . Page 202.
Facts
Byron Thornhill was convicted of "loitering or picketing" near a place of business, pursuant to § 3448 of the 1923 Code of Alabama.  Thornhill had been charged with loitering near the Brown Wood Preserving Company with the "intent or purpose of influencing others" to interfere with lawful business during a strike by a local union affiliated with the American Federation of Labor.  After his conviction in the Inferior Court of Tuscaloosa County, he appealed to the Circuit Court of Tuscaloosa County.  He was originally fined "$100 and costs," but was sentenced to prison for 59 days after not paying.  After he failed his appeal, the circuit court increased the prison time to 73 days. Furthermore, the court of appeals affirmed the rulings of the two lower courts.  The Alabama Supreme Court denied Thornhill's petition for certiorari, but the U.S. Supreme Court subsequently granted the petition. 
Charges
 The State of Alabama, by its Solicitor, complains of Byron Thornhill that, within twelve months before the commencement of this prosecution he did without just cause or legal excuse therefor, go near to or loiter about the premises or place of business of another person, firm, corporation, or association of people, to-wit: the Brown Wood Preserving Company, Inc., a corporation, engaged in a lawful business, for the purpose or with the intent of influencing or inducing other persons not to trade with, buy from, sell to, have business dealings with, or be employed by the said Brown Wood Preserving Company, Inc., a corporation, for the purpose of hindering, delaying, or interfering with or injuring the lawful business or enterprise of the said Brown Wood Preserving Company, Inc., a corporation.

Judgment
The majority opinion reversed the lower courts' rulings by citing the freedoms of speech and the press granted in the first amendment, and secured by the fourteenth.  The court also found the Alabama statute to be invalid on its face. 
Significance
Implicit in Thornhill was the idea that picketing could be curtailed if the picketers marched with signs that went beyond the issues in the particular labor dispute; this would come up in later cases.Ball, Howard. Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior. Oxford University Press. 2006. . Page 202.

From "Thornley v. United States" ==> """
Thornley v. United States, 113 U.S. 310 (1885), was a lawsuit brought against the United States to recover the balance due on pay to the appellant who had been an officer of the U.S. Navy..
Facts 
The appellant alleged that on September 1, 1855, he was commissioned a surgeon in the navy; that on June 1, 1861, while he still held the grade or rank of surgeon, he was, by order of the Secretary of the Navy, issued by direction of the President, placed on the retired list, in accordance with the provisions of an Act of Congress approved February 21, 1861, 12 Stat. 150, by reason of incapacity for further service at sea, but that for some years after said retirement, he was assigned to and performed active duty; that by § 3 of the Act of Congress approved July 15, 1870, the sea pay of an officer on the active list of the navy of the grade or rank held by the appellant at the time of his retirement was fixed, for the first five years from date of commission at $2,800 per annum; for the second five years from the date of commission at $3,200 per annum; for the third five years from the date of commission at $3,500 per annum; for the fourth five years from the date of commission at $3,700 per annum, and after twenty years from the date of commission at $4,200 per annum.
The petition further alleged that an Act of Congress approved March 3, 1873, 17 Stat. 247, fixed the pay of officers of the navy, who were then or might thereafter be retired on account of incapacity, resulting from sickness or exposure in the line of duty at 75 percent of the sea pay of the grade or rank which they held at the time of their retirement; that the Act of Congress approved April 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 41, entitled "An act for the relief of Medical Director John Thornley, United States navy," the appellant, directed that he be considered as having been retired from active service as a surgeon and placed on the retired list of officers of the navy, June 1, 1861, on account of physical incapacity originating in the line of duty, and that he be paid accordingly.
These sections have been reproduced in the Revised Statutes, and read as follows, respectively:
The Act also provided that no officer on the retired list of the navy should be employed on active duty except in time of war. 
The contention of the appellant is that upon these enactments he is entitled to what is known as "longevity pay." The contention of the United States is that longevity pay is only given to officers on the active list of the navy, and not to retired officers, to which latter class the appellant belongs.
The statute allowing longevity pay to officers of the army, § 1262, Rev.Stat., declared that there should be allowed and paid to all officers below the rank of brigadier general ten percent of their current yearly pay for every term of five years' service, but it did not restrict the increased pay to officers in active service. The point on which the case turned was the decision of the court, that an officer of the army, though retired, was still in the service, and he was included in the very terms of the statute allowing the increased pay. The statute on which the appellant relies excludes him, by its terms, from its benefits.
Decision
The court was not called on to explain why the US Congress should apply one rule to the officers of the army and another to the officers of the navy. It is sufficient to say that it has clearly done so. If the law is unequal and unjust, the remedy is with Congress and not with the courts.
The judgment was affirmed.

Thornton also suggests a separate justification for an evidentiary search "when it is reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle."541 U.S. at 632.
Thornton and Belton were distinguished by Arizona v. Gant,. which restricted searches incident to arrest to circumstance where: 1) it is reasonable to believe that the arrested individual might access the vehicle at the time of the search; or 2) it is reasonable to believe that arrested individual's vehicle contains evidence of the offense that led to the arrest; or 3) the officer has probable cause to believe that there may be evidence of a crime concealed within the vehicle.  Thus, while Arizona v. Gant modifies the search incident to arrest doctrine, it also leaves intact certain legal justifications for warrantless searches set forth in Chimel v. California,. Thornton, and United States v. Ross..

From "United States v. Throckmorton" ==> """
United States v. Throckmorton (98 U.S. 61) is an 1878 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court on civil procedure, specifically res judicata, in cases heard at equity. A unanimous Court affirmed an appeal of a decision by the District Court for California upholding a Mexican-era land claim, holding that collateral estoppel bars untimely motions to set aside the verdict where the purportedly fraudulent evidence has already been considered and a decision reached. In the opinion it distinguished between that kind of fraud, which it called intrinsic, and extrinsic fraud, in which deceptive actions exterior to the proceeding prevented a party, or potential party, to the action from becoming aware of the possibility they could vindicate their rights in court.
The land claim at issue had been filed with the district court in the early 1850s by Richardson, a settler who had lived in California since 1838. He had followed Mexican procedures; Mexican government records verified this and suggested that he would receive the grant but the final decree had never been sent. So, the U.S. federal government claimed, he went to former Mexican governor Manuel Micheltorena with his land claim pending and obtained from him a backdated decree, supported by perjured affidavits from purported witnesses to the signing. Only in the 1870s, while reviewing other paperwork, did government lawyers in the Attorney General's office learn of this and bring the case.
Justice Samuel Freeman Miller found little precedent supporting the government's position, and much in opposition, including not only decisions of American courts but those of English courts dating to the beginning of the 18th century. He also cited established legal principles of double jeopardy and the state's interest in not having litigation continue indefinitely. On the facts of the case, he noted that the original petition had taken the court five years to approve, and it was thoroughly inspected, or could have been, by the government's lawyers at the time. Nor did the government offer any new evidence of the fraud, or indicate that the Attorney General had authorized the new litigation.
The rule laid down in Throckmorton has been seen as problematized by Marshall v. Holmes, a decision issued 13 years later in a similar case seeking to revisit a result due to the use of allegedly forged evidence; in it a dictum suggested that courts could set aside verdicts in cases of intrinsic fraud if they found the results obtained to be unconscionable. A circuit split developed over which case was controlling during the late 1930s, but the Court declined to resolve it, although it has modified and clarified the rule in several decisions since then; Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) has also limited Throckmortons applicability. The Third Circuit and several states have rejected Throckmorton in favor of Marshall.
Underlying dispute
At some time prior to 1838, W.A. Richardson settled in what was then Alta California, under Mexican sovereignty. After establishing himself, he petitioned the Mexican governor to grant him title to the land he had been living on. Records from the governor's office, and Richardson's espediente, showed that there was no objection or previous claim to the property or Richardson's continued residence there, and that the petition would likely be granted. But Richardson never received the actual decree from the governor's office.
After California became a U.S. state in 1850, Richardson petitioned its Board of Land Commissioners to have his title accepted under its laws, which the board granted in 1853. Afterwards, it was appealed to the federal District Court for California, which affirmed it in 1856; an appeal to the Supreme Court was withdrawn by the Attorney General the following year. Richardson's petition was supported by a decree signed by Manuel Micheltorena, former Mexican governor of Alta California, and affidavits from eyewitnesses attesting to his having signed the document on a date when he was governor.
Richardson died and his heirs sold the land. By the 1870s, it came to the attention of the Attorney General's office that he had actually obtained Micheltorena's signature in 1852, during the pendency of the land claim before the board of land commissioners, long after the former governor had any authority to sign such a decree, and backdated it. The affidavits supporting his signature were likewise allegedly perjured. Howard, a lawyer representing the government at the board, had apparently been aware of this ruse, or at least its possibility, but did not inform the commissioners.Throckmorton, at 69
Howard by then owned some of the Richardson land. In 1876, the federal government filed a petition in the district court, naming him and the other landowners, with Throckmorton as the lead defendant, asking to have the land claim invalidated on the grounds that it had been fraudulently obtained. The court declined; the government appealed to the Supreme Court.
Supreme Court

Writing for a unanimous court that ruled against the government, Justice Samuel Freeman Miller first took note of the fact that at the time of the disputed grant, Richardson had already been living on his land for almost 20 years; the Court also had never held in any other cases arising from claims in formerly Mexican lands that receipt of the final documentation was absolutely necessary to prove title, especially when the claimant was already in possession. While the government's brief had discussed the fraud upon the court in the original proceeding at great length, Miller also noted, it made no allegations of malfeasance against Howard,Throckmorton, 62–63 an omission suggesting the government believed that he had merely been negligent.
Miller turned next to the government's arguments. He agreed that unlike a private plaintiff the government was not bound by a statute of limitations, but that would not suffice to sustain the motion. The question was whether the Court had jurisdiction. He agreed that "fraud vitiates the most solemn contracts, documents, and even judgments", but also that the "lapse of time ... the difficulty of proving the fraud, and ... the protection which the law throws around rights once established by formal judicial proceedings in tribunals established by law, according to the methods of the law" make it difficult to expose older frauds.Throckmorton, 64–65
This led Miller to two Latin legal maxims: interest rei publicae, ut sit finis litium ("there is a public interest in there being an end to litigation") and nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadam causa ("no one shall be punished or tried twice for the same cause"). The procedures to remedy mistakes of law or fact in trials, such as appeals or retrials, were well-established and did not offend these principles as long as the procedures were followed. "But there is an admitted exception to this general rule in cases where, by reason of something done by the successful party to a suit, there was in fact no adversary trial or decision of the issue in the case", he continued. These would include situations where deception was employed to keep evidence out of the case, or to prevent the defendant from being aware of the action, corrupt behavior by an attorney—situations that, Miller said, kept a party from presenting a full case in court, and thus there was greater latitude for allowing a new proceeding, citing many state and federal precedents.Throckmorton, 64–65
By contrast, "the doctrine is equally well settled that the court will not set aside a judgment because it was founded on a fraudulent instrument, or perjured evidence, or for any matter which was actually presented and considered in the judgment assailed" Miller wrote, quoting a work on res judicata, since it was usually the parties' responsibility to unearth evidence of fraud during the original action. There was only one American precedent that suggested otherwise.Throckmorton, 65–66
Miller reviewed some of the precedents in the case, starting with Tovey v Young, a 1702 case heard by the English Court of Chancery, where a merchant who had unsuccessfully sought to recover from a cheesemonger who had sold to his agent even after the merchant had let the cheesemonger know he had revoked the buyer's purchasing authority asked for a new trial, having learned since the judgement that the supposedly primary defense witness was a partner of the cheesemonger's. The case had already been unsuccessfully appealed to the Master of the Rolls, and Miller quoted the opinion of Lord Keeper Nathan Wright: "New matter may in some cases be ground for relief, but it must not be what was tried before; nor, when it consists in swearing only, will I ever grant a new trial, unless it appears by deeds, or writing, or that a witness on whose testimony the verdict was given was convicted of perjury, or the jury attainted."
That passage had been cited in an 1814 opinion of New York's Court of Chancery, denying a new trial to a salt merchant. After a judgement against him for breach of contract, the man had learned that the plaintiff had arranged a fictitious salt sale with one of his witnesses at a price over market value in order to win a higher damage award. Chancellor James Kent noted that the merchant had to have known that the price of salt would be an issue at trial, and could reasonably have been expected to prepare evidence of that.Throckmorton, 66–67
"The best discussion" of this issue, Miller said, was in an 1854 divorce case heard by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The plaintiff sought to have the divorce granted to her former husband five years earlier reversed due to fraud and collusion. The court's chief justice, Lemuel Shaw, had reviewed the earlier precedents and distinguished intrinsic fraud, which was what the government alleged in the instant case, from extrinsic fraud, the actions he had described earlier which would serve to prevent a truly honest and fair trial and thereby justify ordering a new trial. "We think these decisions establish the doctrine on which we decide the present case", Miller concluded.Throckmorton, 67–68
Miller believed this rule was in the greater interest of the judicial system: "That the mischief of retrying every case in which the judgment or decree rendered on false testimony, given by perjured witnesses, or on contracts or documents whose genuineness or validity was in issue, and which are afterwards ascertained to be forged or fraudulent, would be greater, by reason of the endless nature of the strife, than any compensation arising from doing justice in individual cases." Again, he noted that the government had offered no proof that Howard's supposed failure to inform the courts of the falsification of the decree and the perjury supporting it had come from any deliberate intent on his part, which if it had might have allowed relief.
Lastly Miller found another reversible error. By statute, only the Attorney General or someone he explicitly authorized to do so could bring this kind of action. Yet the paperwork bore only the name of Walter Van Dyke, then U.S. Attorney for the District of California. It did not appear as if he or anyone in the government was even very interested in the case, as no lawyer representing its side had appeared at oral argument.Throckmorton, 70
A copy of a bond attached to the record, but unmentioned within it, signed by some private individuals and holding the federal government harmless, did say that the Attorney General had authorized Van Dyke to bring the action. Miller was not convinced. "It would be a very dangerous doctrine, one threatening the title to millions of acres of land held by patent from the government, if any man who has a grudge or a claim against his neighbor can, by indemnifying the government for costs, and furnishing the needed stimulus to a district attorney, institute a suit in chancery in the United States to declare the patent void."Throckmorton, 71
Subsequent jurisprudence
Supreme Court
A little over a decade after Throckmorton, Marshall v. Holmes seemed to offer an exception to what it had announced as an ironclad rule. But given the chance to speak more clearly to the issue five years later, the Court declined. The only time since that it has considered the question of equitable relief over intrinsic fraud, in the mid-20th century, it has created another exception.
Marshall v. Holmes
thumb|right|Justice Harlan in 1890
In 1891, the Court heard Marshall v. Holmes, in which the petitioner, a New York woman, sought on appeal from Louisiana state court to have her attempt to set aside a judgement against her due to allegedly fraudulent evidence removed to federal court in her native state under diversity. Justice John Marshall Harlan, a member of the Throckmorton Court, wrote for an again unanimous Court that held in her favor.
Marshall sought a new trial on the grounds that a letter used as evidence in the original trial had been forged. Harlan reiterated the existing doctrine that courts of equity will not normally disturb a verdict reached at law, but then quoted from the Court's 1813 Marine Insurance Co. v. Hodgson decision to the effect that "any fact which clearly proves it to be against conscience to execute a judgment, and of which the injured party could not have availed himself in a court of law, or of which he might have availed himself at law, but was prevented by fraud or accident, unmixed with any fault or negligence in himself or his agents, will justify an application to a court of chancery." At the end of his list of precedents Harlan added "See also United States v. Throckmorton".Marshall, 595-96"
Another recent case from Louisiana, Barrow v. Hunton, had invoked the "somewhat nice", as Justice Joseph P. Bradley put it, distinction between cases where a litigant seeking federal jurisdiction merely alleged error and those where new evidence of fraud was available. In that case it had found the fraud intrinsic, but in two other cases, applying the same rule, the fraud was determined to be extrinsic, making the proceeding original and clearing the way for federal review. "These authorities would seem to place beyond question the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to take cognizance of the present suit, which is none the less an original, independent suit, because it relates to judgments obtained in the court of another jurisdiction", Harlan wrote. A federal court's order barring the respondent from enforcing the state court's order would thus not be in conflict with federal law barring federal courts from staying the proceedings of state courts, rather "[i]t would simply take from him the benefit of judgments obtained by fraud."Marshall, 598–600
Graver v. Faurot
Five years later the Court was asked to resolve an apparent contradiction between Marshall and Throckmorton, or at least clarify the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic fraud, in Graver v. Faurot. In 1889 Graver sued Faurot after an investment the latter had recommended to him went poorly; Graver believed that Faurot had concealed both the company's true condition and his interest. But after both Faurot and his codefendant, Bailey, the company owner, denied the scheme under oath, Graver agreed to dismiss the case., hereafter Graver I, hereafter Graver II
Three years later, Faurot's bank failed, and from records disclosed during the bankruptcy proceedings, including records filed with the federal government two years prior to the transaction, Graver was able to confirm his original suspicions: Faurot had actually owned a portion of the company, and he and Bailey had agreed to divide the proceeds of the deal with Graver. With this evidence in hand, Graver went to the Northern District of Illinois, seeking equitable relief and a chance to retry the case.

Judge James Graham Jenkins found Graver's petition to be an original suit that he could consider. "Assuming the facts to be as stated in this bill, I have been impressed with the conviction that the complainant has been grievously defrauded", he wrote in 1894. But he could not determine whether Throckmorton and Marshall controlled and thus whether he could grant Graver relief:Graver I, at 242–244
Jenkins ruled procedural for the defendants and suggested the problem might be resolved on appeal.Graver I, 245–246
The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decided to certify the question to the Supreme Court before attempting to decide the case. In 1896 the Court unanimously declined. As part of the record, the Seventh Circuit had submitted the entire case, which, Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote, put the Supreme Court in a difficult position. Statute forbid the appellate circuits from submitting an entire case to the Court without a specific question or questions to resolve.
"[I]f we should find that the bill was insufficient when tested by principles accepted in both the cases referred to, we should be indisposed to return an answer not required for the disposition of the case," Fuller observed. "This practically requires us to pass upon the whole case as it stands, and to decide whether the demurrer was properly sustained or not." Thus, he said, the Court would not consider the question unless the whole case was appealed to it.
On remand, the Seventh Circuit issued its decision, holding provisionally for Graver, later that year. Judge William Allen Woods wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel that carefully considered the distinction drawn in the two cases. "[M]anifestly it is not true of a complainant in equity that when he brings his bill he must come prepared with proof to maintain it, and to meet any defense which may be interposed", he wrote. "It is his privilege to search the conscience of his adversary by requiring, him to answer under oath, and if possessed of no other evidence, or means of obtaining it, he must accept or at least yield to the answer as true."Graver II, 261–262 Because of the false testimony the case could not go to trial, bringing it under Throckmortons exception for extrinsic fraud. "The present case does not come within the strict letter, and certainly not within the spirit or reason, of the rule", Woods wrote. Ultimately, Woods concluded, it was not necessary to reconcile the two cases; in fact both of them justified holding for Graver. "There can be and ought to be no repose of society where for such wrongs the courts are incapable of giving redress."Graver II, 263
Toledo Scale Co. v. Computing Scale Co.
Almost 30 years after Graver, the Supreme Court revisited Throckmorton in a patent infringement dispute, Toledo Scale Co. v. Computing Scale Co.., hereafter Toledo Scale III
The case had begun in 1906 when the respondent sued the petitioner (now Mettler Toledo), alleging infringements of two of its patents on the aluminum cylinder scale it had begun making the previous year. Four years later, the suit before the Court had been brought by Computing in Chicago, alleging a violation of the Smith patent for its eponymous product. Toledo sought in its defense to have the Smith patent invalidated through prior art, noting that its apparent innovations were actually covered by another patent granted in 1870 to Phinney,, hereafter Toledo Scale I an inventor in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. In 1912, just before the Seventh Circuit was to consider Toledo's appeal, it sent representatives to Pawtucket to research the history of the Phinney patent. They came to believe that Computing, who Toledo portrayed as an aspiring monopolist bitter over Toledo having exposed the dishonesty of one of its products in 1902,, hereafter Toledo Scale II had suppressed evidence of the prior art related to the Phinney patent; the company introduced affidavits to this effect and petitioned for a rehearing in district court on the grounds of extrinsic fraud. It offered no other evidence, in the belief that it could not adequately demonstrate how the Phinney patent covered the material in the Smith since Phinney had deposited a wooden model with his application.Toledo Scale, at 419–420
The court declined to remand the case to district court and held for Computing on the grounds that the Smith patent had proven workable while the Phinney patent had not. Eight years later, after investigating in Pawtucket more thoroughly, Toledo found evidence to back up its earlier claims, such as Computing having purchased most of the extant Phinney scales as it could and induced witnesses to remain silent. It returned to the Seventh Circuit and petitioned anew to have the case retried in Ohio, outside the circuit, where Computing had initially sued.
"A true definition of intrinsic fraud should demonstrate what extrinsic fraud is not, and should draw the line of demarcation between the two", wrote Judge Francis E. Baker, who had also written the 1913 opinion, citing Throckmorton as the authority on the subject, and finding it uncontradicted by other cases, including Marshall and Barrow. From that case, he defined intrinsic fraud as "any fraudulent conduct of the successful party which was practiced during the course of an actual adversary trial of the issues joined and which had no effect directly and affirmatively to mislead the defeated party to his injury after he announced that he was ready to proceed with the trial." That would include the use of perjured testimony and/or forged documents; only the original court can grant relief should the fraud be discovered after the decision was rendered.Toledo Scale II, at 495
By contrast, Baker read Throckmorton as holding that extrinsic fraud was:
In these cases, any court of equity could entertain an action seeking to remedy the fraud.
The court accepted the fraud allegations as true, noting that "though less iniquitous than the affirmative use of forged documents, false exhibits, and perjured' testimony, [they run] counter to one’s sense of ideal fair play." But that was not enough to settle the issue of whether Toledo was entitled to a new hearing, and Baker, repeating Throckmortons Latin maxim about how litigation must end at some point, considered the fraud to be intrinsic, since Computing could have obtained all the evidence it later uncovered at the time of the original trial and thus had not done due diligence at that time. "Computing Company's alleged purchases did not prevent Toledo Company from securing abundant examples of the Phinney scales prior to May 1913".Toledo Scale II, at 496
thumb|right|Chief Justice Taft
Toledo appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard the case two years later and unanimously held for Computing a month after oral argument. Chief Justice and former President William Howard Taft, reiterated the Seventh Circuit's finding that Toledo was not entitled to equitable relief as it had had the opportunity to find the evidence of prior use of the Phinney scale, and some extant models, in Pawtucket and Philadelphia before 1913 had it seriously pursued that information. Referencing Throckmorton, he allowed that while there was debate about the "sometimes nice" distinction between the two types of fraud,Toledo Scale III, at 421 it was not applicable in this case: "[W]e have been cited to no case where it has been held that fraud is extrinsic when the court rendering the decree attacked had before it the same issue of fraud on the same facts, only a little more elaborated as to the motive of the party charged with committing it."Toledo Scale III, at 423
The holding of Toledo Scale has since been incorporated into the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 60(b)(2) allows a motion for a new trial in cases where there is "newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial."
Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co.
In Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., the Court considered the question of when an apparently intrinsic fraud might be, under special circumstances, unconscionable enough to warrant relief. The case arose from another patent claim, brought by the respondent against its competitor a decade earlier.
Lower courts
In the late 1920s, Hartford–Empire had developed, and patented, a technique for getting glass into molds called "gob feeding". During the course of the application, lawyers for Hartford wrote an article praising gob feeding as a revolutionary new technique with the intent of having it published in a reputable journal under the name of a supposedly impartial effort; William Clarke, president of the American Flint Glass Workers' Union, agreed to attach his name to it as author when it was published in The Glass Budget. Shortly after the patent was granted, the company sued Hazel–Atlas, a competitor, for infringement, in the Western District of Pennsylvania.Hazel-Atlas, at 240–241
The Clarke article was part of the evidence Hartford's attorneys introduced, although they did not make much use of it in their case; it was considered file wrapper. While Hazel had received some information regarding the article's true origin, they chose not to introduce it to impeach the article, since doing so might bring the court's attention to statements in it favorable to Hartford that they could not effectively rebut. Relying on other arguments, they won a judgement that there had been no infringement since gob feeding was not sufficiently new and innovative enough to be patentable. Hartford appealed to the Third Circuit, this time emphasizing the article in its brief. Hazel only made minor arguments against some of the facts in it, keeping to itself what it had been told about the authorship. The district court was reversed in 1932 by a divided panel,, hereafter Hazel-Atlas I with Judge Joseph Buffington's majority opinion quoting extensively from the Clarke article.
Hazel then attempted to investigate the true authorship of the Clarke article more seriously, to form the basis for an attack on the judgement. That attempt was frustrated when a Hartford attorney reached Clarke first and concluded an agreement with him to accept payment for the article in return for remaining silent.Hazel-Atlas, at 242–243 Hazel, no longer seeing any possibility of prevailing in court, and seeing the profit possibilities of coming to an arrangement,Hazel-Atlas I, 772–775 paid Hartford a million dollars in licensing fees. Shawkee, another of Hartford's competitors, also learned the truth and attempted to petition for a rehearing and certiorari from the Supreme Court, but was denied.
Hard proof of the truth behind Clarke's article remained a secret for seven years. When the federal government brought an antitrust suit against Hartford in 1939, the documents and records showing how the company had solicited him to claim authorship of the article and later paid him came out during discovery. Hazel, along with another of Hartford's competitors that had paid a substantial licensing fee, petitioned the Third Circuit for leave to refile its original claim with the district court; the judges decided that since the fraud had been perpetrated on the appellate court it should be the one to rehear the case.
In 1943 a divided Third Circuit held for Hartford. Judge Charles Alvin Jones wrote for the majority that both Hazel and Shawkee had had the knowledge to bring the fraud to the appeals court's attention nine years earlier, and that in any event the court had not relied to a great extent on the article; the only reference Hazel's attorneys made to it during the proceedings concerned a claim they accepted as true about the commercial success of gob feeding. It also believed it lacked the power to overturn the lower court even if it had agreed that the Clarke article was the decisive evidence in the 1932 court's reversal. Hazel and Shawkee were advised to attack the patent itself as the product of fraud in district court, Jones wrote: "It is in such an instance, i.e., where the question of alleged fraud in the procurement of a decree is placed squarely before a court having jurisdiction to hear and dispose of the matter, that the rule of United States v. Throckmorton ... and Marshall v. Holmes ... as to whether the alleged fraud is extrinsic or intrinsic, becomes germane."
Judge John Biggs Jr., in dissent, disputed the majority's finding that the Clarke article had not had much of an impact on the 1932 decision; if it had not, he asked, why had Buffington quoted from it so liberally, and would he have done so if he had been aware of its true origins? It was misleading in a way that went straight to the point of the decision, which found no prior art behind gob feeding. "I think that Judge Buffington and this court were deceived in precisely the fashion that Hartford-Empire intended."
Nor did Biggs agree that Hazel and Shawkee had failed to do sufficient due diligence at the time. At trial they had no need to bring the article's origins up since Hartford had only submitted it then to demonstrate what the Patent Office had to consider, and when they began to investigate its origins after the appellate verdict Hartford's lawyers paid Clarke off so that he would not reveal the truth to Hazel's private investigators, a transaction only revealed years later. "If I am correct in my conclusions, Hazel-Atlas, lacking competent proof of the fraud, in its petition for rehearing would have had to have made serious charges against Hartford-Empire and three of its counsel basing its allegations on hearsay evidence which it had been unable to substantiate", Biggs wrote. "This is a course upon which a prudent litigant should and would embark with great reluctance."
Supreme Court
thumb|right|Justice Black
Hazel appealed to the Supreme Court, which decided the case in its favor almost a year later. "Every element of the fraud here disclosed demands the exercise of the historic power of equity to set aside fraudulently begotten judgments", Justice Hugo Black wrote for a five-justice majority. Citing both Throckmorton as establishing the general rule against disturbing old judgments with intrinsic fraud and Holmes as requiring an exception where the fraud was unconscionable, he took note of the sophisticated nature of the scheme and its successful execution against not only the Patent Office but the appeals court, based purely on the sworn testimony of Hartford's own lawyers.Hazel-Atlas, 245–246
Like Biggs, Black did not see that Hazel could have done anymore than it did at the time of the original case to find the fraud:
Black conceded that it was impossible to assess the impact the Clarke article had had on the Third Circuit, but said that was beside the point as Hartford's lawyers had clearly meant for it to matter. And the Third Circuit did have the power, by hearing a petition to grant leave to reopen the claim in district court past the term of the original judgement.Hazel-Atlas, 247–250
"The total effect of all this fraud," Black concluded, "practiced both on the Patent Office and the courts, calls for nothing less than a complete denial of relief to Hartford for the claimed infringement of the patent thereby procured and enforced." The majority ordered the Third Circuit to not only vacate its 1932 holding and dismiss Hartford's appeal, but to instruct the district court to set aside its judgement based on that appeal and reinstate its original holding for Hazel that the patent was invalid. "To grant full protection to the public against a patent obtained by fraud, that patent must be vacated", Black concluded.Hazel-Atlas, 250–251
While he did not dispute that Hartford's attorneys had committed fraud on the court, Justice Owen Roberts's dissent criticized the majority's drastic response as exceeding the Court's constitutional powers. "We should not resort to a disorderly remedy, by disregarding the law as applied in federal courts ever since they were established, in order to reach one inequity at the risk of perpetrating another", he wrote. The Court should properly have only reversed the Third Circuit's decision and allowed for a new trial on the patent claim. That might not even be necessary if the government nullified the patent, as it had been able to do at any time since the truth of the Clarke article was exposed. The offending lawyers were subject to professional discipline.Hazel-Atlas, at 252
Recalling Toledo Scale, Roberts believed that if Hazel had introduced the evidence it had even in 1932, such as an affidavit from its investigator as to how evasive Clarke was when questioned about the article, that would have been enough to reopen the case in district court and possible settle the question there. He further questioned Hazel's motivations for belatedly pursuing Hartford, noting that having ultimately profited from its licensing arrangement with Hartford it, too, was a defendant in the government's antitrust suit. Thus it was in Hazel's interest to "cast an anchor to windward" and put some distance between itself and Hartford.Hazel-Atlas, 265–68

In a footnote Roberts expounded on the intrinsic vs. extrinsic fraud distinction, referencing Throckmorton:
Federal courts
Appellate courts
Several years apart during the 1930s, two different federal appellate circuits considered the unresolved tension between Throckmorton and Marshall, coming to opposite conclusions. The Supreme Court never heard either case, but courts have divided over whether it needs to choose between the two.
American Bakeries Co. v. Vining
In 1935 Judge Halsted L. Ritter of the Southern District of Florida considered American Bakeries Co. v. Vining, a bill of review brought before him by a company that had, after being held liable for injuries to an 18-month-old girl struck by one of its trucks, sought unsuccessfully to have the case reheard on the grounds that the girl's father had conspired to have several witnesses, including the first physician to attend her, perjure themselves at trial. The company had turned to federal court for equitable relief after losing at the Florida Supreme Court.
A month later, Ritter held for the defendant (the original plaintiff), finding the bakery guilty of laches. It had grounded its attack in Marshall, while Vining invoked Throckmorton in response. Since the Supreme Court had declined to use Graver to resolve the issue, he could consider both cases precedent and decide which one applied. After quoting both cases at length, he found Throckmorton more relevant to the instant case, as a clear case of intrinsic fraud. "[T]he fraud alleged in the bill here was presented to the state courts of competent jurisdiction," Ritter wrote, "and there heard and tried upon a voluminous taking of testimony before court commissioners".
American Bakeries appealed to the Fifth Circuit, which returned a decision by the end of the year. Judge Samuel Hale Sibley wrote for a unanimous panel that upheld the district court. "It is apparent that the facts testified to by the soi-disant eyewitnesses and by the physician ... were actually contested in the trial", he said. "The fraud and perjury were not so successful as to deceive the opposite party and prevent a contest."
While the respondents relied on Throckmorton to reinforce their case for intrinsic fraud, the petitioners "retort that a successful conspiracy by a plaintiff with his witnesses is more than a simple perjury or forgery, and ought, when discovered, always to be examinable as an extrinsic fraud when the conspiracy itself was not discovered and made an issue in the trial", as Sibley characterized their argument. He conceded that it was "shocking to judicial sensibility" that a verdict based on fraud could stand, but it was the lesser evil compared to the possibility of endless litigation based on fraud claims. "The law does not guarantee correctness of juridical fact-finding, but, on condition of diligence, a fair and full trial only."
Publicker v. Shallcross
Four years later, the Third Circuit took the opposite view. The petitioner in Publicker v. Shallcross had defaulted on his mortgage for a Philadelphia building, and after convincing the receivers that he was worth only $3,000, settled the $850,000 debt for a mere $8,500, paid by several of his friends. Three years later, the receivers discovered that he had greatly underrepresented his net worth at the time and successfully petitioned the district court to vacate the decision. Publicker appealed, seeing the case as purely a question of law, effectively admitting to the alleged misconduct but relying on Throckmorton to bar review.
"Appellant's position seems to be that, in his circumstance, wickedness, as well as virtue, is its own reward", wrote Judge William Clark. Publicker's brief relied heavily on Throckmorton, but "[w]e do not consider ourselves bound by that case for two, as we think, excellent reasons. We do not believe it applies to our circumstance and we do not believe it is the law of the Supreme Court today."
Clark pointed to Throckmortons two legal maxims about the public interest in litigation ending, and double jeopardy. He then quoted from two Harvard Law Review articles criticizing that stance, on two grounds: that a judgement procured through fraud is inequitable no matter whether the other party could have exposed the fraud or not, and that any new claim alleging perjury or forgery must be supported by evidence. Another law review article pointed out that in Wisconsin, where the state supreme court rejected the Throckmorton rule, it had since heard only four cases seeking new trials on the ground of perjured evidence. Clark also noted that the risk of perjury in the instant case was higher as the hearing officer does not typically take an adversarial stance toward debtors and the receivers do not have the personal stake in the outcome that might motivate them to more fully investigate a debtor's claims about their financial situation.
Clark looked instead to Marshall, "a source of bewilderment" to lower courts since 1891, which Publicker's attorney had apparently been unaware of. He again quoted at length a Columbia Law Review article taking note of the "hazy region of uncertainty" between Throckmorton and Marshall, saying that as long as courts are free to pick and choose between them, "there will be no federal rule at all." Calling Marshall the "more salutary" of the two, Clark wrote for himself and his colleagues that the district court would be upheld as "[w]e believe truth is more important than the trouble it takes to get it."
Publicker petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case, but it denied certiorari.
Josserand v. Taylor
Two years after Hazel-Atlas, the now-defunct Court of Customs and Patent Appeal (CCPA) reaffirmed Throckmorton and rejected both Publickers argument that Marshall overruled it and the argument that Hazel-Atlas had significantly modified it. In Josserand v. Taylor it considered the petition of Taylor, a previous patent litigant who had learned that testimony for Josserand about the viability of his claimed invention at an interference proceeding several years prior had been perjured. Judge Charles Sherrod Hatfield wrote for a five-judge panel that unanimously ruled for Josserand.
Taylor had argued both that Marshall had overruled Throckmorton, and if it had not then Hazel-Atlas definitely had, since it had explicitly disregarded the intrinsic-extrinsic distinction. First, Hatfield countered, the Hazel-Atlas Court had not expressed any opinion on the distinction, nor attempted to define the two terms. Second "we think it is clear from the decision in that case that the Court was of opinion that the fraud therein referred to was extrinsic or collateral to the issues finally determined by the Circuit Court of Appeals in that case."Josserand, at 253–255
Hatfield noted that the sentence in Hazel–Atlas citing both Throckmorton and Pickford, as well as the footnote to that sentence, citing cases including Publicker, "apparently has caused some confusion as to what the Court intended to be understood as holding in that case." But nothing in that footnote suggested any intent by the Court to overrule Throckmorton. Among the other cases cited was Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Co. v. Callicotte, in which the Eighth Circuit had found no conflict between Throckmorton and Marshall, Hatfield observed.
Hatfield concluded:
Other appellate court cases
Three years after Marshall, in United States v. Gleeson, the Second Circuit rejected the idea that it had in any way overruled Throckmorton. In denying a motion to vacate a naturalization obtained through alleged misrepresentation, Judge Emile Henry Lacombe noted that in another recent case which turned on the same issue, after the circuit had cited Throckmorton without writing an opinion to uphold the district court's denial of review, the appellant twice petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari, both times with briefs citing the unresolved issues between the two cases, and was denied both times.Bailey v. Sundberg,145 U.S. 628 and 154 U.S. 494 "Until the attention of this court is called to some decision of the Supreme Court," Lacombe wrote, "other than Holmes v. Marshall, criticising or limiting the doctrine of U.S. v. Throckmorton, it would seem that the principle of stare decisis should preclude its entertaining a bill which seeks to vacate or annul a judgment solely on the ground that such judgment was procured by means of the perjured testimony of the party whom it benefits."
In 1945, the Second Circuit took note of the "unsettled question" of the two cases when considering the petitioner's claims that a necessary stipulation in 1945's Griffith v. Bank of New York was obtained from her under duress. Relying on Marshall to hold that the district court could indeed grant equitable relief, Judge Charles Edward Clark noted that while Throckmorton had limited that power to cases of extrinsic fraud, "later cases no longer seem to adhere strictly to even this limitation". He cited specifically Publicker and Hazel-Atlas, but held the bank's duress to be extrinsic since it had prevented Griffith from fully and fairly presenting her case.
In 1942, three years after Publicker, the Fourth Circuit affirmed Throckmorton in Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Abbott, citing Hilton v. Guyot and Toledo Scale as supporting precedent. Four decades later, it divided over the question of whether an employer's fabricated evidence, including false affidavits, of union violence during a strike a decade earlier, was intrinsic or extrinsic. The union had unsuccessfully likened the company's actions, which included instructing a nonunion employee to take a truck off the property and severely damage it, then file a false police report attributing the damage to striking workers, was similar enough to Hartford's planted article in Hazel-Atlas to warrant the same result. Taking note of the "debate regarding the effect of Marshall v. Holmes", visiting Judge Joe M. Ingraham of the Fifth Circuit wrote that the Fourth Circuit followed Throckmorton and thus held for the majority that "[p]erjury and fabricated evidence are evils that can and should be exposed at trial, and the legal system encourages and expects litigants to root them out as early as possible."
Dissenting judge John D. Butzner Jr. found too much resemblance to Hazel-Atlas to sustain the district court's verdict. That case, too, he noted, had been a settled matter for almost as long before the fraud was discovered, and while Black's opinion had referred to the conspirators behind it as officers of the court, not all were lawyers; the leader, who had written the purported Clarke article, was a "patent attorney", a term used at the time for a company's agent before the Patent Office, who was not himself a lawyer. And just as Hartford had deceived not only the Patent Office but the Third Circuit, the company in the instant case had deceived the courts and a federal agency, the National Labor Relations Board, which decertified the union partly due to the alleged violence.Great Coastal, at 1359–1366
Later Third Circuit cases maintained that per Publicker "in this circuit no significance is attached to the distinction, sometimes articulated in the caselaw, between intrinsic and extrinsic fraud." In 1986 the circuit's chief judge, John Joseph Gibbons, was particularly dismissive of that distinction, saying it "was overruled, if it was ever the law, by Marshall v. Holmes" and that it "probably would not in any event survive Erie Railroad v. Tompkins and Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, at least with respect to judgments in diversity cases." In a footnote Gibbons further characterized the distinction as "chimerical".
The following year the Fifth Circuit had its say about the validity of Throckmortons distinction in Browning v. Navarro, one of many federal and state cases to arise from a lengthy and contentious bankruptcy proceeding. Writing for a unanimous panel that reversed the district court only to allow the appellant to revisit a state court judgement he alleged to have been obtained through collusion with the judge, Judge E. Grady Jolly first considered the case in the light of Heiser v. Woodruff, the controlling precedent in bankruptcy law for when a federal court may allow a challenge to a state court's decision. But while that case had mentioned "judgements procured by fraud" as those from which equitable relief may be granted, it did not define fraud, so Jolly turned first to Throckmorton.
Jolly found the most relevant aspect of Throckmorton to have been the government's claim that Howard had been aware of the forged documents yet failed to inform the district court, and the lack of any evidence of either Howard's negligence or malfeasance. He found the elaborate scheme, and the involvement of officers of the court, in Hazel-Atlas, clarifying. "Hazel-Atlas is to be read as an expansion of the limits set by Throckmorton in attacking judgments generally, but not as granting other courts as broad a power to question judgments as Heiser grants bankruptcy courts", Jolly wrote. "Hazel-Atlas allows a judgment to be attacked on the basis of intrinsic fraud that results from corrupt conduct by officers of the court."
District courts
Thomas v. Hunter
Tenth Circuit judge Walter A. Huxman, sitting a case in the District of Kansas, relied on Throckmorton to free a prisoner. The petitioner, Thomas, previously arrested and convicted on charges of transporting stolen automobiles across state lines, sought a writ of habeas corpus after being arrested in Missouri on the same charge as well as violating his parole. Among the allegations in his petition was that his attorney, Dyer, had not been present when the jury in the second case returned its verdict, denying him the effective assistance of counsel.
Dyer had testified at an earlier coram nobis hearing that he had been present for the verdict. He was not present to testify at the habeas hearing, so the transcript of the earlier hearing was introduced, but Thomas attacked it as hearsay, so it was excluded, and the government offered no other evidence to rebut him. Thomas's petition was granted and he was released.
Within the ten-day deadline provided to file for a rehearing, the government did so, offering sworn affidavits from the U.S. Attorney and his assistant, who had been present. Its petition was granted and with the new evidence at the rehearing, Thomas was ordered returned to prison, a decision upheld on appeal. He filed the instant habeas petition, arguing not only his original case but that the rehearing should never have been granted as the prosecutors had had a fair chance to discredit his testimony as to Dyer's presence and thus that issue was res judicata.
The evidence offered to support Dyer's presence at the verdict was not conclusive: the attorney had gone back to his office when the jury retired, and one of the prosecutors had said in an earlier letter that he could not recall whether Dyer was present. But Huxman wrote that if Thomas's account were assumed arguendo to be false, Throckmorton was "the leading case on the subject ... [even if] somewhat weaken[ed]" by Hazel-Atlas. "Even if we assume that Thomas was guilty of fraud," Huxman wrote, "it was not extrinsic fraud. His fraud certainly did not deceive the respondent or prevent him from fairly presenting his case because he had facts in his possession at that time which he subsequently used to obtain a modification of the judgment."Thomas, at 930–931
In re de Banati
In 1972 the District of Puerto Rico weighed in on the Throckmorton–Marshall relationship. Judge José Victor Toledo held in In re de Banati that the latter case "seems not to have gone as far as the debtor believes" since it only applied when relief at law was not available. "Furthermore, [Marshall] can only be read in the context of the procedural aspect of removal to a federal court, which circumstance may have justified Mr. Justice Harlan's language and his overpassing Throckmorton sub silentio."
State courts
Ward v. Town of Southfield
In 1886, eight years after Throckmorton and before Marshall, the New York Court of Appeals, that state's highest court, became the first state court of record to consider the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction with Ward v. Town of Southfield. The petitioner, tax collector in the village of Edgewater, part of the Town of Southfield (both now defunct and absorbed into New York City) in Richmond County (coterminous with Staten Island), had been successfully sued by the town for $4,000 in uncollected taxes in 1872, out of a roll of $66,000. Only after paying the judgement did Ward discover that the assessors' affidavit attached to the roll was so defective that there was no legal authority to collect any taxes. Ward sued to set the judgement aside and get his money back; after the town prevailed he appealed.
Judge Robert Earl held for a unanimous court in favor of the town. The warrant to collect the taxes, which did not have the affidavit attached (Ward's original defense in the suit), was properly executed and would not have been a basis for questioning the legality of the tax collection. None of the taxpayers Ward collected from expressed any doubt as to their legality or refused to pay on those grounds. And had he collected all the taxes, Ward noted, there would have been no grounds for suit against him, regardless of the affidavit.Ward, at 294
Relying in part on Throckmorton, Earl distinguished those cases where relief might be granted:
A decade later Judge Woods quoted this passage when the Seventh Circuit made its first attempt to reconcile Throckmorton and Marshall in Graver.
Pico v. Cohn
Five years after Ward, the California Courts of Appeal became the first state court to formally adopt Throckmorton in Pico v. Cohn, resulting in the two often being cited together as authorities on the fraud on the court issue. Pico was the petitioner's effort to have a judgement that a sale of property to him was in fact a mortgage and thus the respondent was entitled to repossess it for nonpayment set aside after he discovered that a key witness whose testimony he had expected to support his claim but did not had been bribed by the respondent on the morning of the trial. Writing for an en banc court, Chief Justice William H. Beatty held that since the petitioner had suspected the bribery but had no evidence, and the court chose to believe the resultant perjured testimony, it was intrinsic fraud under Throckmorton and the case was unreviewable. "[W]e think it is settled beyond controversy that a decree will not be vacated merely because it was obtained by forged documents or perjured testimony."
The use of bribery to induce the perjury did not make the fraud extrinsic, Beatty continued, since while the money had changed hands outside of the courtroom the practical effect was within, during the proceedings. He agreed that the wrong was "most grievous" but said that it was for the legislature to address it in a way that would not give rise to endless litigation "in which nothing was ever finally determined, [which] would be worse than occasional miscarriages of justice." A litigant at trial:
The court did not find any distinction between the instant case and Throckmorton, and noted also other state cases supporting it.
Maryland Steel Co. v. Marney
At the turn of the century the Maryland Court of Appeals, also that state's highest court, accepted Throckmorton as controlling in Maryland Steel Co. v. Marney. The petitioner had sought to vacate a judgement several years earlier in favor of one of its employees blinded in an accident after learning that the employee had conspired with several former coworkers to testify that they were present at the time of the accident when they were in fact elsewhere. Judge Andrew Hunter Boyd wrote for a unanimous court affirming lower-court rulings in favor of the employee, on the grounds that the company could have easily discovered the truth before trial and confronted Marney and his witnesses with it but did not. He later discussed at some length the distinctions, or lack thereof, between the different types of fraud.
Boyd cited Throckmorton and Pico, which he found "very similar to this case in many respects",Maryland Steel, at 373 quoting extensively from both, in opposition to the prospect of endless litigation. "[T]here is perhaps no infamous crime more frequently attributed to others than that of perjury", he wrote. "The losing party to a cause is too frequently ready to attribute his defeat to the false swearing of witnesses, and the frame of mind he is in, under such circumstances, easily enables him to reach the conclusion that his opponent has procured such false testimony by means of money or other unlawful inducement." Therefore, the petitioner was required to support that claim with strong evidence.Maryland Steel, 374–375
Boyd took the position that situations like the one in Pico and the instant case in which an opposing party was accused not merely of perjury but suborning that of others, where the defeated party was otherwise reasonably able to have discovered this at the time of the trial. "In the first place, witnesses are not apt to commit perjury against the wish of the party calling them and they, as a rule, perhaps do not do so without some expected compensation" he wrote. "It may not be money, but if it is to obtain the favor or the good will of a litigant, although he pays them no money, it is just as reprehensible as if the consideration was a pecuniary one." Boyd allowed that an exception might exist where a party or witness had been convicted of perjury in the original trial, as that would be a bar to continued litigation, but that was not an issue in the case at bar, so the court did not need to decide it.Maryland Steel, 377–378
Schwartz v. Merchants Mortgage Co.
In 1974 the Schwartzes, alleging a conspiracy among the respondents, asked the Court of Appeals to reconsider Maryland Steel and how the Throckmorton rule, as adopted then, might be affected by Marshall, citing specifically Shammas. Judge J. Dudley Digges wrote for another unanimous court, citing the principle of stare decisis:
Boring v. Ott
thumb|right|Justice James Kerwin
In 1909 the Wisconsin Supreme Court became the first court to reject the rigidity of Throckmorton in Boring v. Ott. The case had been brought by Boring, the executor of an estate, 17 years after discovering that the respondent had allegedly misrepresented an agreement with the decedent, Pool, which he claimed gave him the right to inherit a quarter share of the decedent's store as in force when it had actually been rescinded. Boring sought to have Ott enjoined from further enforcement of the judgement. Justice James C. Kerwin wrote for the majority, suggesting while Throckmorton was generally good law it could stand to be broadened.
Throckmorton had, as a necessity of articulating a rule, not defined extrinsic fraud very clearly, Kerwin observed.; he also took note of Marshall as having modified the rule. For that reason, "it is not easy to see why an issue determined solely by the perjury of the prevailing party does not amount to such a fraud, where such perjury was unknown to the defeated party, and could not by the exercise of reasonable diligence have been discovered," he wrote. "It would seem that a judgement thus obtained is as unconscionable as one secured by keeping a party away from court or by other corrupt means, and thereby preventing a fair trial on the merits."Boring, at 868.
So, having held that Throckmorton would not bar the court from considering the motion as a matter of law, Kerwin considered the facts, which he found wanting, not up to the standards set by Tovey and other precedents. Ott had consistently denied the alleged perjury, and the circumstantial evidence suggested that the agreement had indeed been in force at the time of Pool's death. "There is not sufficient evidence to make out a case for the plaintiff to that high degree of proof required by the authorities."Boring, at 870.
thumb|left|Justice Roujet D. Marshall
The lone dissenter, Justice Roujet D. Marshall, would also have denied relief, but because he believed Throckmorton to be good law. Marshall, he wrote, "bears all the earmarks of having been decided without full appreciation of the situation the [C]ourt had created." If the Court had considered Throckmorton at all, Marshall speculated, it was to decide that the use of forged documents to secure the peitioner's signature on a contract was extrinsic fraud and thus fit for relief. In support of that proposition, Marshall argued that "in many cases decided since 1891 ... the Throckmorton rule is found vindicated in all its integrity".Boring, at 876.
Alexander v. Hagedorn
The Texas Supreme Court's 1950 Alexander v. Hagedorn decision has been criticized by both its dissent and outside commentary as an unduly harsh and rigid application of Throckmorton, since it held as intrinsic fraud a false unsworn statement that had the effect of denying the defendant in the original lawsuit his day in court. It began when the petitioners, a married couple, swerved off a rural road into a ditch one night to avoid colliding with a mule that they testified later as one they recognized as being owned by respondent. Since it was a violation of local law to allow livestock to wander onto roads, they sued over the damage to their car and injuries to Mrs. Alexander.
When the deputy sheriff served Hagedorn, an immigrant who could speak English but not read or write it, Hagedorn asked the deputy to tell him what the papers said. He then appeared at court on the designated day, only to find it was not in session. He asked the clerk when it would be, and the clerk asked Hagedorn if he had retained an attorney; Hagedorn answered that he had not. Hagedorn gave the clerk his address and asked the clerk to notify him when the case would be heard.
Hagedorn did not hear from the court again. Seven months later he learned that his bank account had been garnished to satisfy a default judgement the Alexanders had obtained against four months earlier. At that proceeding, the Alexanders had told the judge, unsworn that they knew the mule belonged to Hagedorn; in reality, it belonged to Hagedorn's son and they were aware of this at that time. Hagedorn then hired a lawyer and brought the action to set it aside, providing proof that his son owned the mule and prevailing both at trial and on appeal. The trial judge testified that had he known the mule's true ownership he would not have granted default judgement.
Writing for a majority of six, Justice Few Brewster found first that the trial court clerk's negligence was legally attributable to Hagedorn, since by asking the clerk to let him know when the trial would be, a task outside the scope of the clerk's statutory duties, he had made the clerk his agent. Since this negligence was thus legally Hagedorn's own, he could not claim any action by the Alexanders had prevented him from offering his defense in court and thus under Throckmorton, Pico and other cases in that line, it was intrinsic fraud and the appeals court was reversed.Alexander, at 999–1002
Justice Graham B. Smedley dissented, joined by William M. Taylor. "[T]he wrongful act of petitioner was a false statement made to the district judge for the purpose of inducing him to hold the hearing in the absence of respondent Hagedorn," he wrote. "It did induce the district judge to proceed, and but for that statement no hearing would have been held and no judgment would have been rendered. It is very clear that petitioner's statement was extrinsic rather than intrinsic fraud." Ruling it intrinsic "is an unnecessary straining in support of an inequitable and unjust judgment", Smedley proclaimed.Alexander, at 1004
Given Hagedorn's difficulties with the language, "he could not be expected to anticipate that the case would be heard without notice to him and a judgment rendered against him for damages in a very substantial amount for which he was in no way liable", Smedley argued. Thus the negligence standard he was held to was too strict. "[He] was diligent to the extent of his capacity, understanding and information."Alexander, 1006–1007
Bryan v. Bryan
In 1951 the South Carolina Supreme Court considered the intrinsic-extrinsic distinction as a question of first impression under state law in Bryan v. Bryan, where the petitioner sought a new trial on the grounds that he had only learned after an earlier judgement against him that damaging testimony by the plaintiffs' witnesses had been perjured. Justice George Dewey Oxner looked to federal authorities, citing Throckmorton as "one of the leading cases. He acknowledged Publickers criticisms, but believed Roberts's footnote in his Hazel-Atlas dissent served to address them. Further, he noted that the Fourth Circuit, which includes South Carolina, had accepted Throckmorton in Aetna.
There had been an earlier case where the court had reversed a lower court and allowed retrial in a case where a plaintiff suing a railroad for collision damage to his car had testified to having paid more for it than the dealer swore to after the trial. But that had resulted from confusion on the plaintiff's part, which mooted the question of the defendant's due diligence. Oxner distinguished the instant case by noting that the petitioner, as defendant, had known before trial who the witnesses against him were and what they would be testifying to, affording him ample opportunity to attack their credibility and materiality at the time. By failing to do his due diligence then, he forfeited his opportunity to enjoin the enforcement of the judgement.
Shammas v. Shammas
thumb|right|Justice William J. Brennan Jr.
New Jersey's Supreme Court decided to reject the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic fraud in 1952's Shammas v. Shammas, where a woman sought to have her divorce set aside on the grounds that her husband had falsely denied under oath an overseas marriage he entered into before the divorce became final. Writing for a six-justice majority, future U.S. Supreme Court justice William J. Brennan Jr., said it was "not clear" whether Throckmorton applied in federal courts. He took note of the opinion that Marshall may have overruled it, but Hazel-Atlas had cited both without resolving the issue. Brennan announced that New Jersey's courts would go further than Federal Rule 60(b) in allowing equitable relief for either intrinsic or extrinsic fraud, as long as it could be well-supported, without any time limit:
St. Pierre v. Edmonds
In 1982 the Utah Supreme Court joined Wisconsin and New Jersey in explicitly rejecting Throckmorton. In St. Pierre v. Edmonds it considered a woman's petition to have her divorce settlement set aside on the grounds that her former husband had obtained her signatures on key paperwork through intimidation. Justice I. Daniel Stewart wrote for a unanimous panel of four (Christine M. Durham did not participate), that "The well established and fundamental doctrines designed to establish the stability of judgments and decrees must yield to the overriding principle that in our system of justice the essential integrity of the adjudicatory process must be preserved. One who would destroy that integrity cannot plead as a defense that his fraud on the system of justice must be protected in the name of preserving judgments."
Stewart discussed Throckmorton and Marshall without saying which was controlling in the case at bar. He considered the distinction between the two types of fraud to have "little merit ... [It] fails to provide a rational basis for the harsh legal consequences which flow from it.". While acknowledging that many courts considered the former case to still be good law, he announced that Utah would join the courts that had, citing Boring and Publicker.
Facey v. Facey
In 2021, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals went to great length to distinguish intrinsic and extrinsic fraud under Throckmorton in Facey v. Facey, in which relief was sought over an allegedly forged signature on a power of attorney document. Even as she reaffirmed that the state's courts had always followed Throckmorton, Judge Andrea Leahy acknowledged the "consternation surrounding the distinction" as she reiterated that caseFacey, at 703–704 and reviewed more than a century of state precedent.Facey, 704–715
Extrinsic fraud "perpetrates an abuse of judicial process by preventing an adversarial trial and/or impacting the jurisdiction of the court [and] ... is normally collateral to the issues tried in the case in which the judgment is rendered", Leahy concluded. Intrinsic fraud, on the other hand, "relates to facts that were before the court in the original suit and could have been raised or exposed at the trial level." On that basis she concluded that the power of attorney at issue in the case was correctly found to be intrinsic fraud by the trial court and thus not reviewable.Facey 715–719
Other state court cases
In 1949, the New Hampshire Supreme Court held that the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic fraud did not matter in divorce cases as that area of law "is governed by general equitable considerations."
The California Courts of Appeal took note of the dissonance between Throckmorton and Marshall when deciding Smith v. Great Lakes Airlines Inc. in 1966. The petitioners sought to enjoin enforcement of an judgement against them obtained by the respondents, who had leased an airplane from them with an option to buy, alleging that the respondents had conspired with government regulators to mislead the court into believing that because of the petitioners' failure to provide adequate maintenance records for the plane within the stipulated time, the respondents had had to perform a required airframe overhaul themselves, at great cost. Judge Otto Kaus affirmed Throckmorton as the law of the state, noting other state cases following it, at the same time as there was "a certain amount of confusion" in the federal courts. He, too, acknowledged Publicker, but declined to follow its lead. "As far as we can determine Marshall v. Holmes has never even been cited in California, let alone followed", Kaus wrote, holding for the respondents.
In 1991 the Oklahoma Supreme Court came down on the side of Throckmorton when granting a physician's request that a judgement against her in a suit she brought over her dismissal from a hospital be vacated due to misrepresentations made during the proceedings by hospital executives. "This court has adopted the essence of the Throckmorton definitions of extrinsic and intrinsic fraud", wrote Justice Marian P. Opala. "[But w]hile the definitions are fairly simple and straightforward, their application has often been somewhat hazy" and thus none of the state cases the hospital cited were enough to prevent the court from siding with the doctor. In a footnote Opala noted the conflict with Marshall, and called it unresolved.Patel, at 1196n28
Australian courts
The Federal Court of Australia's South Australia district described Throckmorton as "still regarded in the United States as the leading authority" on the fraud issue in 1992, when it considered in Monroe Schneider Associates v No. 1 Raberem Pty. Ltd. the claim by an appellant that the appellee had actively suborned perjury from a witness at trial. While the court cited Black's distinction in Hazel-Atlas of the involvement of officers of the court in the fraud as a reason to consider the allegation, it found the evidence insufficient to merit setting aside the original judgement.
In a 2003 case, Modric v Srisawat, the District Court of Queensland considered an allegation by one driver whose vehicle had been damaged in an accident several years earlier that the alleged driver of the other vehicle and her husband had perjured themselves at trial when they claimed she had not been the driver involved in the accident. He sought to set aside the original judgement in favor of her and her insurer on grounds of fraud. Judge Alan Wilson held for the defendants that while the evidence of the alleged perjury could not have been uncovered through due diligence at trial, the plaintiff's own account of the accident was not credible enough to make it unambiguous that the defendant was the other driver. In support, he cited Throckmorton and quoted the same passage from Tovey v Young, as well as Hazel-Atlas.
Analysis and commentary
Early 20th century
Criticism of Throckmorton dates to the early 20th century. In 1909 the Harvard Law Review carried the unsigned commentary that Judge Clark quoted from extensively in Publicker. The writer addressed the case's underpinnings in its goal of making sure that litigation eventually came to an end. He argued that the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic fraud mattered less than the fact of a litigant being cheated of a fair trial, and that any litigant alleging fraud had to come to court ready to prove it. "With these safeguards against undue litigation the lesser evil is to follow the equity of the matter." But in a 1916 survey of courts throughout the U.S., Britain and Canada regarding fraud-based attacks on judgements in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, Graham Woodward called Throckmorton "particularly well considered and worthy of the most careful thought".
Judge Clark also cited a 1921 commentary in the Columbia Law Review that was among the first to note the conflict between Throckmorton and Marshall: "The Supreme Court of the United States, to show its utter impartiality, has ruled both ways, and left the spectacle of two cases, one of which holds that false evidence is ground for reversal, the other that it is not, both of which have been followed, and neither of which has been overruled." The writer advocated for a firmer rule grounded in the interest of deterring overlong litigation. "Should an indefinite amount of litigation be permitted for the sake of securing questionable advantages to a very small number of litigants?" But as long as this debate remained unsettled, "the only possible answer in spite of repeated assertions that the federal rule is clear, is that there is no federal rule at all. And there will be none until one or the other of the conflicting decisions is overruled."
Later 20th century
In the mid-20th century, Hazel-Atlas and the 1946 amendments to Rule 60(b), under which the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction does not apply to judgements within a certain time frame (six months at that time, a year now), drew fresh commentary. "The present weight of Throckmorton would perhaps not be as great", a 1951 Vanderbilt Law Review article observed, "if the courts were to consider the procedural differences existing at that time." The writer, Harold Dedman, noted that the equitable relief that was the only remedy available in the late 1870s has since largely been supplanted by legislation specifying more clearly the situations in which new trials may be granted.
"It has caused much embarrassment to courts which give it token recognition," so they have found ways to reclassify fraud as extrinsic to get around it, Dedman added. Most commonly, they had relied on a fiduciary or other relationship between the parties to do so. At the same time, "some courts have shown by their inner turmoil that the harshness of the rule is  recognized, and yet go very far to sustain it."Dedman, at 340
But Dedman noted that English courts have never drawn the same distinction. And in Wisconsin, Boring had not been complemented with any state equivalent of Rule 60(b), yet did not "seem to be encouraging excessive and endless litigation." He speculated that perhaps the high burden of proof required for fraud in the state might have an effect.Dedman, at 341
Dedman dismissed the idea that Rule 60(b) had overruled Throckmorton; instead it had merely given any party alleging intrinsic fraud a year after the judgement to make their claim.Dedman, at 342 Nor did Marshall displace the earlier holding; according to Dedman it had not made a direct holding and only suggested the possibility of relief through unconscionability.Dedman, at 342n42 "Its validity is doubtful", he said of the distinction. But "[b]y adverting to the procedural aspects of the cases originally establishing the rule, it  is possible to distinguish them." He expected courts to continue expanding the definition of extrinsic fraud, but suggested a rule change eliminating the distinction and providing that "the objection that a judgement would never be final does not apply" when equitable relief is sought before the same court which originally pronounced judgement.Dedman, 342–343
The following year, Dean Wagner, a Duke law student, considered the relationship between Throckmorton and Marshall in the wake of Hazel-Atlas and the new language of Rule 60(b), which the drafters of the latter had indicated in their notes was prompted by that decision, in his university's law review. In Hazel-Atlas, he argued, the Court had carved out an exception to Throckmorton and yet implicitly prodded lower courts to adhere more strictly to it, so it was not surprising that they had continued to choose whichever precedent suited them. But the CCPA's holding in Josserand had come down squarely against reading Hazel-Atlas as holding that Marshall limited Throckmorton in any way. "This decision is  important," he said, "for if the court's interpretation of the Hartford case is correct the new Federal Rule  becomes merely a re-statement of the old Throckmorton rule."
Wagner noted the contrary influences on the courts in two cases of the D.C. Circuit. In a 1951 probate case it had affirmed the district court's denial of a petition to set aside the acceptance of a will on the grounds that it had been procured by fraud and perjury. Judge Bennett Champ Clark's opinion held that the alleged misrepresentation was unreviewable intrinsic fraud that the petitioners had raised but not prevailed on at trial; he stated explicitly in considering the applicability of Rule 60(b) that Josserand had held that Hazel-Atlas did not in any way change Throckmorton. Yet a year later, in setting aside a divorce on the grounds that the wife had misrepresented her fidelity and financial situation under oath at trial, Judge Henry White Edgerton, writing for a panel that included Clark, again cited Hazel-Atlas in holding that that Rule 60(b) did not limit the power of a court to "at any time set aside a judgment for after-discovered fraud upon the court."Wagner, at 47–48
In Shammas, the New Jersey Supreme Court had gone further than its federal counterpart and "attached a definite understanding to the meaning of [fraud on the court]", Wagner wrote. He proposed that the distinction between what fraud was reviewable and what was not, and the greater issue of the balance between not allowing endless litigation and not allowing frauds to go unremedied, lie not on whether it took place within the action but on the moving party's due diligence during the original action.
Wagner argued that Hazel-Atlas indicated at the very least an intention to broaden the scope of Throckmorton; in his opinion, it had applied Marshall. And "[u]ntil the Supreme Court redefines its position the "manifestly unconscionable" test will be the only test, and it will remain, as it has been, that despite Federal Rule 60(b) there is no federal rule at all."Wagner, at 49–50
Two widely-cited books on federal civil procedure have also criticized the lack of clarity from the Supreme Court on whether Throckmorton or Marshall controls, and the ensuing difficulty of distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic fraud. Charles Alan Wright and Arthur R. Miller's 55-volume Federal Practice and Procedure calls the authorities "clouded and confused" and notes that there seem to be three results: " some lower courts appl[y] the Throckmorton rule, others [give] it `token recognition,' and others reject[] it altogether."11 Wright & Miller's Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. §§ 2861, 2868 (3d ed. 2020), cited at Facey, 703 The Moore's Federal Practice series repeats its author's Yale Law Journal observations from shortly after Hazel-Atlas that "at times it is a journey into futility to attempt a distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic matter", citing Callicotte as an example:
He suggested instead that courts focus on how extensive the fraud was and the alleging party's due diligence.
21st century
In 2011 Texas Tech law professor Dustin Benham wrote that the Supreme Court's recent decisions in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly and Ashcroft v. Iqbal could allow for the elimination of the intrinsic-extrinsic distinction through heightened standards for the pleading of fraud. The two cases were seen as overruling the 1957 Conley v. Gibson holding that litigants asking for relief from an earlier decision on grounds of fraud, mistake or other irregularity needed only to show that the alleged irregularity was conceivable, and replacing it with plausibility as the standard.
Benham saw Throckmorton as a well-intended decision that was born of a time, the common law pleading era, when it was easy for unscrupulous unsuccessful litigants to fabricate allegations of perjury and forgery, thus the Court's bar on actions alleging intrinsic fraud. "But the distinction was difficult to apply from the beginning and became less practical and equitable as the decades passed," he wrote, as the categories became magnified in the code pleading and modern notice pleading eras, a development he attributed to the low standards under Conley. Benham said it was time to abolish the distinction as conceptually flawed, inconsistently applied, and unnecessary under Twombly and Iqbal.Benham, 678–689
Use by supporters of Donald Trump's attempt to overturn 2020 presidential election results
In 2021, supporters of former U.S. president Donald Trump who believed his defeat by Joseph Biden in the previous year's election had been the result of widespread voter fraud in several states brought lawsuits in those states in an attempt to have the election result overturned. On social media, they cited Throckmorton, quoting the line "Fraud vitiates everything" from the decision, reading it to mean that if it could be proven that even one state's results were so tainted by fraud as to be unreliable, the entire election was void.King v. Whitmer (E.D.Mich., 2021) 20-13134), at 55–57. Retrieved September 20, 2021.
Sidney Powell, Lin Wood and several other lawyers representing voters who had supported Trump cited Throckmorton in a case they brought in the Eastern District of Michigan against Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer. The city of Detroit, the Democratic National Committee and other parties joined as intervenors for her defense. In her final opinion in 2021, among other criticisms of the plaintiffs' case and attorneys (all of whom she recommended professional sanctions against for bringing a frivolous case), Judge Linda Parker briefly addressed their use of Throckmorton.
"Plaintiffs' counsel's citation to Throckmorton is puzzling," Parker wrote, "both because the case relates to a nineteenth-century land grant and has nothing to do with election law and because the Supreme Court held that the grant could not be collaterally attacked on the basis that the judgment was procured by fraud." She saw their attempt to introduce it as proof that the case was "driven by partisan political posturing, entirely disconnected from the law ... the dangerous product of an online feedback loop, with these attorneys citing 'legal precedent' derived not from a serious analysis of case law, but from the rantings of conspiracy theorists sharing 
amateur analysis and legal fantasy in their social media echo chambers."
Throckmorton had nothing to do with election law and could not be applied in that context, Parker reiterated. The "fraud vitiates everything" phrase they had fixated on was from a legal treatise Justice Miller was quoting from, and not part of the opinion itself. Most importantly, in Throckmorton the Court had declined to follow that maxim.

From "Thryv, Inc. v. Click-To-Call Technologies, LP" ==> """
Thryv, Inc. v. Click-to-Call Technologies, LP, 140 S. Ct. 1367, was a 2020 decision by the United States Supreme Court regarding whether inter partes review institution decisions by the United States Patent and Trademark Office were subject to judicial review.  Writing for the majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg issued an opinion finding that such decisions were not judicially reviewable.  Justices Neil Gorsuch and Sonia Sotomayor dissented from the majority's ruling, arguing that neither Congress or the Constitution authorized a lack of judicial review of such decisions.
Background
In 1998, the Patent Office awarded U.S. Patent No. 5,818,836 to Stephen DuVal for an invention pertaining to anonymizing telephone calls.  Duval licensed the patent to InfoRocket.com, Inc.  In 2001, InfoRocket sued a predecessor of Thryv, Inc., alleging that Thryv had infringed upon the '836 patent.  Following protected litigation that involved challenges to the validity of the '836 patent, the parties settled their claims and jointly dismissed the lawsuit.
In 2011, Duval transferred the license of the '836 patent to Click-to-Call who then proceeded to file a new patent infringement lawsuit against Thryv.  In response to this new lawsuit, Thryv filed a petition for inter partes review with the patent office seeking to invalidate the patent.  Click-to-Call argued that Thryv's petition was untimely because, under 35 U.S.C. § 315(b), no inter partes review proceeding can be initiated more than 1 year after being served with a complaint alleging patent infringement.  The Patent Office rejected this argument, finding that, because the 2001 lawsuit had been voluntarily dismissed, Section 315(b) did not serve as a bar to inter partes review.
Click-to-Call subsequently appealed the Patent Office's determination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  The Federal Circuit, sitting en banc, ruled in Click-to-Call's favor, holding that, while 35 U.S.C. § 314(d) generally barred judicial review of the Patent Office's decision to institute inter partes review, there was no evidence that Congress specifically intended for determinations regarding the 1-year bar to be unreviewable.  The decision was issued by a sharply divided court, with several Federal Circuit judges dissenting.  On June 24, 2019, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and held oral argument on December 9, 2019.
Decision
thumb|Justice Ginsburg authored the Court's majority opinion.
The Supreme Court issued its ruling on April 20, 2020.  Writing for a seven justice majority, Justice Ginsburg held that Section 314(d) bars courts from reviewing determinations regarding the 1-year time bar to filing inter partes review petitions.  Justice Ginsburg's opinion rested heavily on the Court's 2016 decision in Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, which had upheld the constitutionality of inter partes review generally and the validity of Section 314(d) specifically.
Justices Gorsuch and Sotomayor dissented from the majority's ruling.  In their view, it was improper to limit the ability of the judiciary to review administrative agency determinations.  Justice Gorsuch in particular re-emphasized his stance from Oil States Energy Services, LLC v. Greene's Energy Group, LLC that it was improper for an administrative agency to revoke an intellectual property right without meaningful judicial review.
Reaction
Reaction among the legal community was mixed.  Writing for SCOTUSBlog, John Duffy described the opinion as having relatively little impact on the state of American patent law, but potentially representing a "a tiny skirmish in a much larger war" surrounding the review-ability of administrative decisions by American courts. Over at IPWatchDog, Gene Quinn criticized the Court's ruling as giving the Patent Office free license to invalidate patents without concern of meaningful judicial review.

From "Tileston v. Ullman" ==> """
Tileston v. Ullman, 318 U.S. 44 (1943), was a United States Supreme Court case.. 
 Procedural history 
The Supreme Court of Errors Connecticut held that §§ 6246 and 6562 of the Connecticut General Statutes of 1930 which prohibited the use of drugs or instruments to prevent conception and the giving of assistance or counsel in their use were constitutional. The Supreme Court of the United States assumed without first determining if the case was an appropriate one for a declaratory judgment, ruled that the statutes "prohibit the action proposed to be done" by appellant and "are constitutional."
 Facts 
The Appellee claimed that the appellant, a physician, committed such an offense for giving professional advice concerning the use of contraceptives to three patients whose condition of health was such that their lives would be endangered by child-bearing. The appellant contended that because of the nature of his patients' exceptional condition in light of the danger child-bearing could pose for them that this was a just reason for the advice to be authorized and necessary. However, his complaint contained no allegations asserting any claim under the Fourteenth Amendment of infringement of appellant's liberty or his property rights. The relief prayed was a declaratory judgment as to whether the statutes are applicable to appellant and, if so, whether they constitute a valid exercise of constitutional power "within the meaning and intent of Amendment XIV of the Constitution of the United States prohibiting a state from depriving any person of life without due process of law."
 Significance 
The sole constitutional attack upon the statutes in question were under the Fourteenth Amendment and confined the physician's contention for depravity of life—not appellant's but his patients'. Thus, the life of the appellant himself was not in danger. No genuine case or controversy essential to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court for this subject-matter existed until Griswold v. Connecticut.
 Holding 
The Supreme Court held that the proceedings in the state courts presented no constitutional question which appellant had standing to assert. No question was raised as to the applicability and constitutionality of the statutes in their application to the physician in respect to deprivation of liberty or property in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the court did not speak to whether it had jurisdiction to enforce a law that prevents the use of contraceptives for the state of Connecticut.

From "Timbs v. Indiana" ==> """
Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court dealt with the applicability of the excessive fines clause of the Constitution's Eighth Amendment to state and local governments in the context of asset forfeiture.
In February 2019, the Court unanimously ruled that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of excessive fines is an incorporated protection applicable to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.
 Legal background 
As formulated, the United States Bill of Rights was meant to restrict the power of only the federal government, not the state or local governments, which was confirmed by the US Supreme Court in Barron v. Baltimore (1833).. However, following the American Civil War, Congress ratified the Fourteenth Amendment which included the Due Process Clause, "[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law". Since its ratification, the United States Supreme Court has followed the  doctrine of incorporation: generally, all Constitutional rights must also be respected at state and local levels across a range of those rights, with the last such ruling on the topic of incorporation made in McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), relating to the Second Amendment.. The Court has carved out only specific exceptions to the doctrine for certain judicial procedural matters. However, the Supreme Court has never made a judgment broadly related to incorporation towards all parts of the Constitution; what Constitutional rights are incorporated to states have been set by specific cases, and the Court had yet to rule specifically on the Eighth Amendment's excessive fines clause.
In more recent years, the question of whether the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive fines applies to state and local laws has been highlighted by the growing use of asset forfeiture, a tactic used since the start of the war on drugs in the mid-1970s to seize cash and material property used in illegal drug transactions. Cash assets are used to help fund law enforcement departments, but it has been found that seized assets like vehicles and homes are sometimes used for personal gain by law enforcers. It has been argued that the use of asset forfeiture is imbalanced against poor people, who are more likely to be caught in drug trafficking and have the fewest assets to lose, and makes it difficult for such people to reintegrate with society without these assets.
The Supreme Court previously ruled in Austin v. United States (1993) that the Eighth Amendment applies to federal asset forfeitures, protecting citizens from excessive fines that would include asset forfeiture.. In the Supreme Court's 2017 term, a petition for a case related to state-level asset forfeiture had been submitted but the Court was forced to reject it since the petitioner had brought up the Eighth Amendment argument only within the writ of certiorari, which made the case ineligible for the Court. However, Justice Clarence Thomas, in his concurrence to the rejection of the petition, established several factors of why state and local asset forfeiture laws should be re-examined under the Eighth Amendment and identified similar criticism regarding the unbalanced nature towards the poor.
 Case background 
Tyson Timbs of Indiana received a cash sum of money from his father's life insurance company upon his father's death in early 2012. Of the money, he used about  to purchase a Land Rover. However, Timbs, who had been a former drug addict, fell back to drugs following his father's death, and spent much of the remaining sum on illegal drug purchases as well as participating in drug sales to support his habit. Timbs was arrested by undercover officers during one such sale in November 2013, selling them about  of drugs. Timbs pleaded guilty to the charges, and was sentenced to a year of house arrest, five years of probation, and  in fines, which he paid. The state, however, also used their forfeiture law to confiscate the Land Rover as a civil action, as Timbs had used the vehicle to transport the drugs. Following his year of house arrest, Timbs found it difficult to get back into society without a vehicle; though he ultimately found a job that accepted his criminal history, it required him to borrow a neighbor's car to make the commute.
Timbs, represented by the Institute for Justice, filed suit against the state, arguing that seizing of the vehicle violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines. A Grant County Superior Court judge ruled in Timbs' favor, finding that the value of the Land Rover was over four times the maximum penalty Timbs could have been fined (), and thirty times over the fines he actually paid, and thus was an excessive fine in the context of the Eighth Amendment. The Indiana Court of Appeals agreed with this ruling on appeal from the state.
However, at the Indiana Supreme Court, the decision was reversed. The Court argued that the Eighth Amendment only applies for federal actions and does not prohibit state or local laws from imposing  excessive fines, and that the Supreme Court had yet to issue any decision that incorporated the excessive fines clause of the Eighth Amendment to the states.
 Supreme Court 
Timbs petitioned the US Supreme Court to hear his case, focused on answering the question of whether the "excessive fines" of the Eighth Amendment apply to state and local governments as through the Due Process Clause. The Court accepted the case in June 2018. Timbs' case received bipartisan support. Among those filing amicus briefs in support of Timbs included the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Judicial Watch, and Pacific Legal Foundation. The United States Chamber of Commerce also filed a brief in support, arguing that just as individuals are harmed by unreasonable asset seizure, companies often end up incurring large fines under state and local laws for small violations.
Oral arguments were heard on November 28, 2018. Observers believed that on the constitutional question, the Justices were weighed heavily in favor of asserting that the excessive fines clause was another right that should be incorporated to states. However, these observers also believed that while the question did favor Timbs' case, the Court appeared to be ready to vacate the Indiana Supreme Court decision and rehear the case to determine if the forfeiture of the vehicle was to be considered as an excessive fine.
The Court issued its decision on February 20, 2019, unanimously stating that the Eighth Amendment's protection from excessive fines was incorporated against the states. The opinion was written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with all but Clarence Thomas joining, stating that the Eighth Amendment is incorporated to states under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Ginsburg's opinion referred to the protection from excessive fines as a key right as early as Magna Carta, and that this protection "has been a constant shield throughout Anglo-American history: Exorbitant tolls undermine other constitutional liberties". Justice Thomas wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment that protection from excessive fines is incorporated, but did not accept that the Due Process Clause was the right constitutional reason for this but generally as part of Privileges or Immunities Clause defined by the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Neil Gorsuch, though joining on the majority opinion, also wrote a similar concurring opinion, stating that the incorporation was best defined as part of the Privileges or Immunities Clause. The Court vacated the Indiana Supreme Court's decision, and remanded Timbs' case to be reheard.
The Supreme Court did not offer any tests in their opinions as to how to measure when fines are deemed excessive, a matter that is expected to require additional case law to establish. Ginsburg's opinion did suggest that the seizure of Timbs' Land Rover was disproportionate to the crime, but this was to be resolved by the lower court.
Subsequent events
Timbs' case was reheard by the Grant County Court, which on April 27, 2020 ruled in Timbs' favor based on the Supreme Court's ruling related to the Eighth Amendment, that seizure of the Land Rover was an excessive fine, and ordered the Land Rover returned to Timbs. While the state appealed the decision, it did agree to return the vehicle on the condition that Timbs would not sell or give it away as the case continued in court.
The State of Indiana again appealed the decision all the way to the Indiana Supreme Court, who this time affirmed in a 4–1 decision the lower courts' rulings that the fine was unconstitutional. They wrote, "today, we reject the State's request to overturn precedent, as there is no compelling reason to deviate from stare decisis and the law of the case; and we conclude that Timbs met his burden to show gross disproportionality, rendering the Land Rover's forfeiture unconstitutional."
Impact
The Court's ruling is expected to affect the use of asset forfeiture at state and local levels, a common practice to help partially fund police forces. There is also speculation by supporters of criminal justice reform that the decision may  affect the use of confiscation of driver's licenses to compel payment of fines and fees, as well as imprisoning those unable to pay bail or fines for otherwise minor crimes.

From "Time, Inc. v. Firestone" ==> """
Time, Inc. v. Firestone, 424 U.S. 448 (1976), was a U.S. Supreme Court case concerning defamation suits against public figures.
Background
Mary Alice Firestone was married to Russell A. Firestone, Jr., an heir to the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company family fortune. Mary filed for divorce, and Russell submitted a counterclaim on the grounds of extreme cruelty and adultery. The judge granted the divorce but discounted much of the evidence concerning extramarital affairs. Nevertheless, Time, Inc., publisher of the weekly news magazine Time, ran an article one week after the divorce was granted, mentioning the alleged affairs.  In the "Milestones" section of Time, the news of the Firestones’ divorce was published as follows: "DIVORCED. By Russell A. Firestone Jr., 41, heir to the tire fortune: Mary Alice Sullivan Firestone, 32, his third wife; a onetime Palm Beach schoolteacher; on grounds of extreme cruelty and adultery; after six years of marriage, one son; in West Palm Beach, Fla. The 17-month intermittent trial produced enough testimony of extramarital adventures on both sides, said the judge, 'to make Dr. Freud's hair curl.'”
Following the publication, Mary Firestone filed suit in a Florida state court against Time, Inc., seeking $100,000 in damages for libel.
Court cases
Time alleged that Mary was a public figure and could not recover damages based on the ruling of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), which protected media from liability in such suits except in cases where there is knowledge of falsity or a reckless disregard for truth.. Both the state court and Florida Supreme Court ruled that Mary was not a public figure, using language defined in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974)..
Decision
In a 6-2 vote, Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion vacating the lower judgment and remanding. The Supreme Court held that the actual malice standard for media reports on public figures did not apply. Firestone was not a public figure as defined by prior precedent. The Court also held the Florida judgment invalid because the court awarded damages without determining fault. Justice Lewis Powell wrote a concurrence, stating that the ultimate question is whether Time exercised reasonably prudent care in light of the ambiguous divorce decree. Justice Potter Stewart joined in the concurrence.

From "Time, Inc. v. Hill" ==> """
Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S. 374 (1967), is a United States Supreme Court case involving issues of privacy in balance with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and principles of freedom of speech. The Court held 6–3 that the latter requires that merely negligent intrusions into the former by the media not be civilly actionable. It expanded that principle from its landmark defamation holding in New York Times v. Sullivan.
The Hill family had sued after Life implied in a blurb that the upcoming film adaptation of The Desperate Hours was based on the real-life incident where they were held hostage in their home by escaped convicts. It was accompanied by a photo of the Hills' house in a suburb of Philadelphia, from which they had moved shortly afterwards due to the lingering psychological effects of the episode. In fact, the plot of the novel and a successful play based on it were, while inspired by the Hills' experience, unrelated to it.
Former Vice President Richard M. Nixon argued the Hills' case before the Court. 
Background
James Hill and his wife lived in Whitemarsh Township, Pennsylvania, with their five children in 1952, when they were taken hostage in their own house by three escaped convicts. During the ordeal, the family members were treated with dignity by the hostage-takers. The family members were held hostage for 19 hours. The three criminals were apprehended after leaving the Hills' home, and the incident received significant media attention. Mrs. Hill did not appreciate the media focus, and the family relocated to Connecticut in order to seek out a lifestyle out of the limelight.
thumb|upright|left|Logo of Life magazine
Joseph Hayes wrote a novel published in 1953 called The Desperate Hours, which was influenced by the Hill family's ordeal. The novel by Hayes went on to become a bestseller. In 1954, the Broadway theatre production of the play The Desperate Hours debuted, which depicted a hostage incident similar to that experienced by the Hill family. However, in The Desperate Hours, the scenario was changed from the Hills' actual experiences, to a fictional portrayal of a family victimized by threats of sexual abuse and other violent acts. The setting for the play was Indianapolis, Indiana.
Life magazine published an article on the debut of The Desperate Hours on Broadway, and included pictures of the actors in the prior residence of the Hills in the Whitemarsh suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In the article, The Desperate Hours was characterized as a "reenactment" of the ordeal experienced by the Hill family. The Life magazine piece wrote that the photographed actors from the play were pictured in "the actual house where the Hills were besieged". Mrs. Hill experienced a mental breakdown after the piece was published, and James Hill stated he was unable to comprehend why the magazine did not fact check the article through communication with the family.
Prior litigation
James Hill filed suit in New York against the magazine's publisher, Time, Inc. The suit asserted Life had violated privacy law in the state, by conflating the Hill family with fictional events which had not actually occurred. The legal argument drew upon the notion of false light as related to privacy law. After an initial ruling against Life magazine, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division remanded the case for a new trial. After litigation through the court system in New York, a decision was found in favor of the plaintiff, with damages awarded of US$30,000.
Supreme Court
Argument
thumb|upright|Richard Nixon argued the Hill position before the Supreme Court.
Time, Inc. appealed the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court, where the Hill family position was argued by former Vice President Richard Nixon, who was elected president two years later.
The position of Life magazine was argued before the Court by attorney Harold Medina Jr., son of U.S. federal judge Harold Medina. In his opening argument, he asserted that the privacy law in question in New York was unconstitutional, due to its broadness and for punitively impacting the press for publishing factual information. As a secondary argument, Medina put forth the notion that the prior ruling in the case was inappropriate because the jury was allowed to determine liability of Life based on the inaccuracy of the article, while neglecting to take into account whether or not the act by the magazine was reckless or willful. He put forth the potential for a lawsuit against the press for a simple unintentional error, "It comes down to if you treat it on a mistake basis, on truth or falsity, what has happened to the law of libel? You don't need the law of libel any more and the safeguards. It is much easier to sue for violation of your right of privacy. But all the defenses that have been set up in the libel law disappear."
Regarding his preparation for the case, Nixon remarked to The New York Times journalist Fred Graham, "I locked myself up in my office for two weeks. No phone calls. No interruptions. It takes a tremendous amount of concentration." Graham later wrote of Nixon's argumentation, "Whatever the peculiarities of Nixon's preparation, his performance before the Court proved sound and workman-like, well within the bounds of effective oral advocacy." Nixon argued that a fictional account is not newsworthy, and therefore freedom of the press is not impacted by the privacy law. His essential premise put forth the notion that the "fictionalization" aspect of privacy law did not harm freedom of expression.
Unpublished draft opinion
In his 1985 book The Unpublished Opinions of the Warren Court, author Bernard Schwartz revealed that an initial conference had resulted in votes of 6 to 3 to affirm the judgment in favor of the Hill family. Justice Abe Fortas wrote a draft opinion, but it was not published by the Court.

After the 1985 publication of Schwartz's book revealed the initial draft opinion of the Court in the case, former President Richard Nixon requested his prior White House Counsel Leonard Garment to investigate the matter. Garment had previously worked with Nixon as his legal partner, and assisted him during the Time, Inc. v. Hill case. Garment contributed an article to The New Yorker which reported on the research undertaken by Nixon before each of the arguments in the case. He recounted Nixon's response after hearing of the verdict of the Court, "I always knew I wouldn't be permitted to win a big appeal against the press." Garment emphasized a comment from the dissent opinion written by Justice Harlan, which warned undesired media attention imparted "severe risk of irremediable harm ... [to] individuals exposed to it and powerless to protect themselves against it."
Following the first argument before the Court, justices changed their opinions about the matter, and Justice Hugo Black wrote in a memo to his fellow justices, "After mature reflection, I am unable to recall any prior case in this Court that offers a greater threat to freedom of speech and press than this one does." Justice Black emphasized that though the media makes mistakes at times in its reporting, requiring press organizations to pay out for claims which were not libel related to inaccuracies which did not hurt individuals' reputation, would engender a situation of self-censorship. A subsequent argument was ordered, and the majority opinion shifted since the initial draft opinion.
Reargument
A second argument before the Court took place in October 1966. Medina requested the Court declare the privacy law in question unconstitutional, because, "[i]n this field of privacy, I merely suggest that when it is nondefamatory and when you are talking about a public fact, we should have the protection that the fellow who comes in to sue us must prove both falsity and knowledge of falsity, or recklessness, and that this is a minimum, because, mind you, this article here, the dissent in the appellate division, found it was an informative presentation of legitimate news."
In his reply to Medina's argumentation, Nixon stated, "It is our contention that in this case it was argued by the plaintiff, it was established by the evidence, it was charged by the court, it was found by the jury, and it was held by the courts of New York in their appeals courts, that Life magazine lied, and that Life magazine knew that it lied. That is the proposition that I content for here."
However, the trial judge in the initial case did not provide the jury with an instruction that it had to provide an opinion of recklessness or willful inaccuracy on the part of Life magazine in order to yield a decision in favor of the plaintiff. Medina concluded the reargument period by emphasizing his view that in case it was determined by the Court that evidence showed the Life magazine staff was aware of the inaccuracy of the article in question, this lack of jury instruction was crucial. Medina said that due to this failure to inform the jury of a requirement to find willful inaccuracy on the part of Life magazine, "I still think I am entitled to win."
Decision
thumb|upright|Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote the opinion of the Court.
In January 1967, the Court determined in a 5–4 decision in favor of Time, Inc. Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. wrote the opinion of the Court. Justice Brennan had previously written the majority opinion in the case of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan in 1964; that case ruled individual officials who were publicly known were not able to obtain claims for inaccurate media coverage except in the case of reckless or willful reporting of said inaccuracies. In this case, Justice Brennan utilized a similar test to the matter at hand. He permitted that Life could have a fresh trial where it could be determined whether or not the magazine's reporting was reckless or willfully inaccurate. Justice Brennan wrote about the balance between freedom of speech and exposure to public view:
The guarantees for speech and press are not the preserve of political expression or comment upon public affairs, essential as those are to healthy government. One need only pick up any newspaper or magazine to comprehend the vast range of published matter which exposes persons to public view, both private citizens and public officials. Exposure of the self to others in varying degrees is a concomitant of life in a civilized community. The risk of this exposure is an essential incident of life in a society which places a primary value on freedom of speech and press.
The majority opinion held that states cannot judge in favor of plaintiffs "to redress false reports of matters of public interest in the absence of proof that the defendant published the report with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard of the truth". This decision had the impact of elaborating on the "actual malice" standard of the Court's prior holding in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, to also include cases involving false light. Although the Court reversed a judgment for compensatory damages, it recognized a clear right not to be spoken about.
A dissent written by Justice Fortas was joined by Justice Tom C. Clark as well as Chief Justice Earl Warren. In addition to Justice Fortas, Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote another dissent. Justice Harlan observed that as Hill was not a public individual, he was unable to obtain significant viewership for a potential response. He pointed out that this created a problem of "unchallengable untruth", and stated a necessity would have been to request Hill prove negligence on the part of Life magazine's editorship in their falsehoods, as opposed to the more stringent test of proving that the inaccuracy was actually reckless or willful.
Analysis
In his book Freedom for the Thought That We Hate: A Biography of the First Amendment, author Anthony Lewis examined the case, and noted, "Using someone's likeness without permission has developed as one of the four branches of privacy law. A second is false light privacy, exemplified by the Hill case: putting someone in a false light by, for example, fictionalizing a story about him or her."
Authors Lyrissa Barnett Lidsky and R. George Wright write in their book Freedom of the Press: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution, "... the Supreme Court requires proof of falsity and fault in all defamation cases involving matters of public concern, although the requisite fault depends on the status of the plaintiff. If plaintiffs were able to avoid these requirements simply by choosing to sue for false light rather than defamation, it would encourage an 'end run' around the First Amendment. The United States Supreme Court foresaw and partially prevented this problem in its first false light case, Time, Inc. v. Hill." Regarding the rationale of the decision by the Supreme Court in the case, the authors noted, "The Court's reasoning was parallel to the reasoning being developed in defamation cases: Errors are inevitable in free debate on matters of public interest, and the press must have breathing space to protect it from liability for such 'inevitable' errors."
Writing as a contributor to A Good Quarrel: America's Top Legal Reporters Share Stories from Inside the Supreme Court, Fred Graham commented on the positions of Time, Inc. in its argumentation before the Court. Graham noted, "Underlying both defenses was the argument that if this judgment was not unconstitutional, then persons who feel they have been defamed can perform an end run around the defenses established in New York Times v. Sullivan by suing for a violation of privacy."

From "Times Film Corporation v. City of Chicago" ==> """
Times Film Corporation v. City of Chicago, or Times v. City of Chicago is the name of two cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1957 and 1961. Both involved the issue of limits on freedom of expression in connection with motion pictures. In both cases the court affirmed the right of local governments to engage in some form of censorship.
Within a few years after the second decision, however, the court had dramatically reversed itself, coming down in favor of broad First Amendment freedoms for filmmakers.
1957 case
The first case, 355 U.S. 35 (1957), was decided on November 12, 1957.
A Chicago ordinance required that before being permitted to screen any film in the city, exhibitors submit the film to the police commissioner's office and pay a license fee. The license to show the film could be denied if the film did not meet certain standards; this denial could be appealed to the mayor, whose decision would be final.
The petitioner wished to exhibit Le blé en herbe (The Game of Love), a French film directed by Claude Autant-Lara and based on a novel by Colette. The film depicted a sexual relationship between an adult woman and a teenage boy.
On May 6, 1955, the petitioner applied for an exhibition permit. On June 2, 1955, the police commissioner denied the permit because the film was indecent. On June 6, the petitioner appealed the decision to the mayor, Richard J. Daley. On June 20, the appeal was denied.
The petitioner then sued the city in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, choosing a federal court because of diversity of citizenship and because the petitioner was alleging infringement by municipal authorities of the petitioner's rights under the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A report by a master in chancery found that the film's sexual content did not violate any law, citing ACLU v. Chicago; that state interests did not justify an ordinance authorizing prior restraint on freedom of expression; and that the Chicago ordinance was vague and thus unconstitutional. The master did allow for a prohibition against persons under eighteen years of age viewing the film.
After the defendants objected to the Master's Report, the District Court issued its ruling on March 21, 1956, sustained their objections, calling the film prurient and stating that the First Amendment still allows local authorities to censor films deemed obscene, noting that the right to free speech under the First Amendment is "not absolute and unlimited.” The court cited Near v. Minnesota;. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire;. and Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson.. The court also asserted that the terms "immoral" or "obscene" were not too vague to merit the ordinance unconstitutional.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision, maintaining that the film's main purpose and effect was “to arouse sexual desires” much more than any other artistic purpose. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a decision announced on November 12, 1957, agreed. The Court issued a one-sentence per curiam opinion, granting the petition for a writ of certiorari  and summarily reversing the judgment of the Seventh Circuit. The decision simply cited an earlier 1957 case, Alberts v. California,. in which a 6–3 majority, in a decision written by Justice Brennan, had held that obscenity was “not within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press” and that the First Amendment was not intended to protect materials that were “utterly without redeeming social importance.”.
1961 case
Background and procedural history
In Times Film Corp. v. City of Chicago, 365 U.S. 43, Times Film Corporation once again wanted to show a film in Chicago but was denied a permit. This time the film was entitled Don Juan. The petitioner paid the license fee but refused to submit the film for examination. When the permit was refused, the corporation sued the city in federal court, arguing that the ordinance violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
The U.S. District Court of Northern Illinois dismissed the suit, stating that it presented no justiciable controversy; the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed, concluding that since neither the film nor evidence of its content had been presented, the case merely presented an abstract question of law.
The United States Supreme Court, however, agreed to adjudicate the case, in which the Times Film Corp. was represented by the ACLU. The Court heard the case on October 19, 1960, and issued its ruling on January 23, 1961. It found against Times Film Corp. on the grounds that it was not challenging the validity of the censor's standards but was challenging the censor's very right to censor.
Opinion of the Court
The Court ruled, 5–4, that “there is not a word in the record as to the nature and content of Don Juan” and that “[t]he challenge here is to the censor's basic authority.” Citing Gitlow v. New York, the court stated, “It has never been held that liberty of speech is absolute.  Nor has it been suggested that all previous restraints on speech are invalid.” The court rejected the petitioner's argument against prior restraint, maintaining that it was not the Court's job “to limit the State in its selection of the remedy it deems most effective to cope” with the problem of obscenity in films..
The majority opinion was written by Justice Clark, with Justices Frankfurter, Harlan, Whittaker, and Stewart joining in the majority opinion.
Dissenting opinions
Both Justices Warren and Douglas wrote dissenting opinions; they were joined by Justices Black and Brennan.
Warren's dissent
Chief Justice Warren's long and probing dissent, in which Justices Black, Douglas, and Brennan joined, argued that the court's decision “presents a real danger of eventual censorship for every form of communication, be it newspapers, journals, books, magazines, television, radio or public speeches. The Court purports to leave these questions for another day, but I am aware of no constitutional principle which permits us to hold that the communication of ideas through one medium may be censored while other media are immune.”
Citing such precedents as Near v. Minnesota and Grosjean v. American Press Co.,. as well as Cantwell v. Connecticut,. in which the court found previous restraint unconstitutional, Chief Justice Warren emphasized that the question presented in the case was not whether an exhibitor has a “complete and absolute freedom to exhibit at least once, any and every kind of motion picture.”  Rather, the question was whether government at any level can “require all motion picture exhibitors to submit all films...for licensing and censorship prior to public exhibition within the jurisdiction.”
Protesting that the court's decision “gives formal sanction to censorship in its purest and most far-reaching form,” Chief Justice Warren compared the Chicago censorship procedure to the “English licensing laws of the seventeenth century which were commonly used to suppress dissent.” Recounting several dozen recent examples of egregious censorship in the U.S., including a Chicago ban on Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator, which the city deemed offensive to German-Americans, he referred to “the evils of the censor's basic authority, of the mischief of the system against which so many great men have waged stubborn and often precarious warfare for centuries.”
Douglas dissent
Justice Douglas, in a briefer dissent with which Justices Warren and Black concurred, wrote that “censorship of movies is unconstitutional because it is a prior restraint and violative of the First Amendment.” Citing statements about censorship from Plato's Republic and Hobbes's Leviathan, he noted: “Regimes of censorship are common in the world today. Every dictator has one; every Communist regime finds it indispensable.” While censors had once been concerned with political satire, they were now preoccupied “with atheism and with sexual morality,” with a variety of groups seeking to “translate into secular law their notions of morality.”
Yet in the U.S., Justice Douglas pronounced, “the state is not the secular arm of any religious school of thought, nor is the church an instrument of the state.”  The First Amendment forbids the government from supporting any censor: “It is not for government to pick and choose according to the standards of any religious, political, or philosophical group. It is not permissible, as I read the Constitution, for government to release one movie and refuse to release another because of an official's concept of the prevailing need or the public good.”
Justice Douglas further warned of “the ease with which the censor can erode liberty of expression.” The point of the First Amendment is “to enlarge, not to limit, freedom in literature and in the arts as well as in politics, economics, law, and other fields....No more potent force in defeat of that freedom could be designed than censorship. It is a weapon that no minority or majority group, acting through government, should be allowed to wield over any of us.”
Legacy
Within a very short time after rendering these two decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court would shift toward a far broader interpretation of the First Amendment. Justice Brennan, who wrote the majority opinion in the 1957 case, would reverse his position on the issue in Miller v. California..
One observer has noted that Chief Justice Warren foresaw the mistake the court was making in the 1961 case. The Court would hear several related cases over the next five years, and by 1965 reversed its decision on censorship, ruling states and municipalities can not necessarily censor films under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

From "Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District" ==> """
Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court that defined First Amendment rights of students in U.S. public schools. The Tinker test, also known as the "substantial disruption" test, is still used by courts today to determine whether a school's interest to prevent disruption infringes upon students' First Amendment rights.
Background
In 1965, five students in Des Moines, Iowa, decided to wear black armbands to school in protest of American involvement in the Vietnam War and supporting the Christmas Truce that was called for by Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Among the students were John F. Tinker (15 years old), his siblings Mary Beth Tinker (13 years old), Hope Tinker (11 years old), and Paul Tinker (8 years old), along with their friend Christopher Eckhardt (16 years old). The students wore the armbands to several schools in the Des Moines Independent Community School District (North High School for John, Roosevelt High School for Christopher, William Harding Junior High School for Mary Beth, elementary school for Hope and Paul).
The Tinker family had been involved in civil rights activism before the student protest. The Tinker children's mother, Lorena, was a leader of the Peace Organization in Des Moines. Christopher Eckhardt and John Tinker attended a protest the previous month against the Vietnam War in Washington, D.C. The principals of the Des Moines schools learned of the plan and met before the incident occurred on December 16 to create a policy that stated that school children wearing an armband would be asked to remove it immediately. Students violating the policy would be suspended and allowed to return to school after agreeing to comply with it. The participants decided to violate this policy. Hope and Paul Tinker were not in violation of the policy, since the policy was not applicable to elementary schools, and were not punished. No violence or disruption was proven to have occurred due to the students wearing the armbands. Mary Beth Tinker and Christopher Eckhardt were suspended from school for wearing the armbands on December 16 and John Tinker was suspended for doing the same on the following day.
Legal precedents and issues
Previous decisions, such as West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, had established that students did have some constitutional protections in public school. This case was the first time that the court set forth standards for safeguarding public school students' free speech rights. This case involved symbolic speech, which was first recognized in Stromberg v. California..
 Lower courts 
A suit was filed after the Iowa Civil Liberties Union approached the Tinker family, and the ACLU agreed to help with the lawsuit. Dan Johnston was the lead attorney on the case.
The Des Moines Independent Community School District represented the school officials who suspended the students. The children's fathers filed suit in the U.S. District Court, which upheld the decision of the Des Moines school board.
A tie vote in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit meant that the U.S. District Court's decision continued to stand, which forced the Tinkers and Eckhardts to appeal to the Supreme Court directly.
The only students involved in the lawsuit were Mary Beth Tinker, John Tinker, and Christopher Eckhardt. During the case, the Tinker family received hate mail, death threats, and other hateful messages.
The case was argued before the court on November 12, 1968. It was funded by the Des Moines residents Louise Noun, who was the president of the Iowa Civil Liberties Union, and her brother, Joseph Rosenfield, a businessman.
Decision
 Majority opinion 
The court's 7–2 decision held that the First Amendment applied to public schools, and that administrators would have to demonstrate constitutionally valid reasons for any specific regulation of speech in the classroom. The court observed, "It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate."Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969). Justice Abe Fortas wrote the majority opinion, holding that the speech regulation at issue in Tinker was "based upon an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression, even by the silent symbol of armbands, of opposition to this Nation's part in the conflagration in Vietnam." This decision made students and adults equal in terms of First Amendment rights while at school. Bethel School District v. Fraser and Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier later rewrote this implication, limiting the freedoms granted to students.
The Court held that for school officials to justify censoring speech, they "must be able to show that [their] action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint," that the conduct that would "materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school."Tinker, 393 U.S. at 509. The Court found that the actions of the Tinkers in wearing armbands did not cause disruption and held that their activity represented constitutionally protected symbolic speech. The Court ruled that First Amendment rights were not absolute, and could be withheld if there was a “carefully restricted circumstance.” Student speech that has the potential to cause disruption is not protected by Tinker.
Dissents
Justices Hugo Black and John M. Harlan II dissented. Black, who had long believed that disruptive "symbolic speech" was not constitutionally protected, wrote, "While I have always believed that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments neither the State nor the Federal Government has any authority to regulate or censor the content of speech, I have never believed that any person has a right to give speeches or engage in demonstrations where he pleases and when he pleases." Black argued that the Tinkers' behavior was indeed disruptive and declared, "I repeat that if the time has come when pupils of state-supported schools, kindergarten, can defy and flout orders of school officials to keep their minds on their own schoolwork, it is the beginning of a new revolutionary era of permissiveness in this country fostered by the judiciary."Tinker, 393 U.S. at 517–18.
Harlan dissented on the grounds that he "[found] nothing in this record which impugns the good faith of respondents in promulgating the armband regulation."Tinker, 393 U.S. at 526.

Subsequent jurisprudence
Tinker remains a viable and frequently cited court precedent, and court decisions citing Tinker have both protected and limited the scope of student free speech rights. Tinker was cited in the 1973 court case Papish v. Board of Curators of the University of Missouri, which ruled that the expulsion of a student for distributing a newspaper on campus containing what the school deemed to be "indecent speech" violated the First Amendment. In the 1986 court case Bethel School District v. Fraser, the Supreme Court ruled that a high school student's sexual innuendo-laden speech during a school assembly was not constitutionally protected. The court said the protection of student political speech created in the Tinker case did not extend to vulgar language in a school setting. The court ruled that similar language may be constitutionally protected if used by adults to make a political point, but that those protections did not apply to students in a public school.
Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier was a 1988 court case where a high school principal blocked the school paper from publishing two articles about divorce and teenage pregnancy. The Supreme Court ruled that schools have the right to regulate the content of non-forum, school-sponsored newspapers under "legitimate pedagogical concerns." The court reasoned that the principal's editorial decision was justified because the paper was a non-public forum since it was school-sponsored and existed as a platform for students in a journalism class. The Court in Hazelwood said that under the doctrine of Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators Association, a 1982 court case that clarified the definition of a public forum, a school facility like a newspaper only qualifies as a public forum if school authorities make those facilities available for "indiscriminate use by the general public."
The Court's rulings in Fraser and Hazelwood state that a “substantial disruption” or infringing on the rights of other students was reason enough to restrict student freedom of speech or expression. Some experts argue that the three individual cases each act independently of one another and govern different types of student speech. It is argued that Fraser does not interfere with Tinker, since Fraser questions sexual speech while Tinker protects political speech. While some believe that Tinker's protections were overturned by Fraser and Kuhlmeier, others believe that the latter cases created exceptions to the Tinker ruling. Others argue that a broad reading of Tinker allows for viewpoint discrimination on certain topics of student speech.
In 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit re-heard a case en banc that had been argued before a panel of three of its judges, considering whether middle school students could be prohibited from wearing bracelets promoting breast cancer awareness that were imprinted with "I ♥ Boobies! (Keep a Breast)." The Third Circuit cited Tinker when ruling that the school's ban on the bracelets violated the students' right to free speech because the bracelets were not plainly offensive or disruptive. The court also cited Fraser, saying the bracelets were not lewd speech. The Supreme Court later declined to take up the case.
Several cases have arisen from the modern display of the Confederate flag. Courts applying the "substantial disruption test" under Tinker have held that schools may prohibit students from wearing clothing with Confederate symbols. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit cited Tinker in the 2013 court case Hardwick v. Heyward to rule that prohibiting a student from wearing Confederate flag shirt did not violate the First Amendment because there was evidence that the shirt could cause disruption. Exceptions to this are the 2010 court case Defoe v. Spiva and the 2000 court case Castorina v. Madison County School Board. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit said in Castorina v. Madison County School Board that based on Tinker and other Supreme Court rulings, the school board could not ban Confederate flag T-shirts while other "controversial racial and political symbols" like the "X" symbol associated with Malcolm X and the African American Muslim movement were permitted.United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit . Castorina v. Madison County School Board. 8 March 2001 http://www.ahcuah.com/lawsuit/federal/castor.htm . In Defoe v. Spiva, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that "racially hostile or contemptuous speech" can be restricted, even if it was not disruptive.United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Defoe v. Spiva. 18 Nov. 2010. http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0358p-06.pdf This deviated from the Tinker ruling, which said the school's restriction of the Tinkers' speech was unconstitutional because it was not disruptive.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit applied Tinker  in February 2014 to rule that a California school did not violate the First Amendment in Dariano v. Morgan Hill Unified School District, where a school banned American flag apparel during a Cinco de Mayo celebration. The school said they had enacted the ban due to a conflict caused by American flag apparel that had occurred at the event the previous year. The Ninth Circuit declined to re-hear the case en banc and the U.S. Supreme Court later declined to review the case.
A Pennsylvania high school cheerleader, who had been reprimanded by her school for using offensive language in a social media post that she made off-campus and outside school hours, filed suit against the school in 2017 claiming her First Amendment rights had been infringed. The district court ruled in her favor, and the school district appealed to the Third Circuit. There, the three-judge panel upheld the district ruling unanimously, but the majority stated that Tinker could never apply to off-campus speech made by a student, while Judge Thomas L. Ambro believed this was too broad a claim. The school petitioned to the Supreme Court, which ruled in June 2021 in Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L. to uphold the ruling in favor of the student, but overturning the decision of the Third Circuit in that Tinker may cover some parts of off-campus speech when the school has a compelling interest, such as for incidents of harassments or threats. However, the Supreme Court did not attempt to define when such off-campus speech fell under a school's compelling interest.
 Tinker Tour 
Mary Beth Tinker decided to embark on a tour around the United States, called the Tinker Tour, beginning in 2013 to "bring real-life civics lessons to students through the Tinker armband story and the stories of other young people." The tour is a project of the Student Press Law Center.

Tinsley v. Treat, 205 U.S. 20 (1907), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that found while an indictment in a removal proceeding constitutes prima facie evidence of probable cause, it is not conclusive, so evidence put forth by a defendant showing that no offense triable in the district to which removal is sought had been committed is admissible, and its exclusion is not mere error, but the denial of a right secured under the Federal Constitution.Tinsley v.

The provisions of the Safety Appliance Act of March 2, 1893, amended April 1, 1896, declared it to be unlawful for any common carrier engaged in interstate commerce to haul or permit to be hauled or used on its line any car used in moving interstate commerce not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars, relate to all kinds of cars running on the rails, including locomotives and steam shovel cars. Johnson v. Southern Pacific.
The object of the statute was to protect the lives and limbs of railroad employees by rendering it unnecessary for men operating the couplers to go between the ends of the cars, and the words "used in moving interstate traffic" occurring therein are not to be taken in a narrow sense.
In a suit based upon the Safety Appliance Act of March 2, 1893, as amended April 1, 1896, the plaintiff is not called upon to negative the proviso of § 6 of said act either in his pleadings or proofs. Such proviso merely creates an exception, and if the defendant wishes to rely thereon, the burden is upon it to bring itself within the terms of the exception; those who set up such an exception must establish it.
Assumption of risk as extended to dangerous conditions of machinery, premises, and the like, obviously shades into negligence as commonly understood. The difference between the two is one of degree, rather than of kind.
Section 8 of the Automatic Coupler Act having exonerated the employee from assumption of risk under specified conditions, the employee's rights in that regard should not be sacrificed by charging him with assumption of risk under another name, for example, with contributory negligence.
In this case, the so-called contributory negligence of the deceased employee was so involved with and dependent upon erroneous views of the statute that the judgment complained of must be reversed.

From "Tison v. Arizona" ==> """
Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court qualified the rule it set forth in Enmund v. Florida (1982).  Just as in Enmund, in Tison the Court applied the proportionality principle to conclude that the death penalty was an appropriate punishment for a felony murderer who was a major participant in the underlying felony and exhibited a reckless indifference to human life.
Factual background
This case stems from an infamous prison break during the summer of 1978. Gary Tison was serving a life sentence at the Arizona State Prison in Florence for killing a prison guard. His three sons, Donald, Ricky, and Raymond, plotted to break him and his cellmate, Randy Greenawalt, out of prison. On July 30, 1978, the sons entered the prison for a visit, taking advantage of a policy that allowed an informal picnic setting for weekend family visits, carrying an ice chest packed with revolvers and sawed-off shotguns. One of them aimed a sawed-off shotgun at a lobby guard. Greenawalt helped in the escape by cutting off telephones and alarm systems.
They escaped in Donald Tison's 1969 Lincoln Continental, but the next day, one of the Lincoln's tires blew out on a stretch of road not far from the California border, near Quartzsite. Marine Sgt. John Lyons, 24, of Yuma, traveling with his wife, son, and niece on his way to visit family in Nebraska, stopped to help.
While Raymond Tison was showing John Lyons the flat tire, the other escapees emerged from the brush. Raymond forced the Lyonses into the Lincoln, and then he and Donald drove the Lincoln down a service road. Meanwhile, the other Tisons transferred their belongings into the Lyonses' car, keeping the Lyonses' money and guns. Gary Tison shot out the radiator on the Lincoln and forced the Lyonses out. John Lyons began begging Gary Tison for his life; Gary Tison remarked that he was "thinking about" killing the Lyonses. Gary told Raymond and Ricky to go back to the Lyonses' car and get some water. According to Raymond, while they were gone, Gary started shooting the Lyonses; according to Ricky, the shooting began once they returned with the water. The two agreed that they had returned in time to watch the elder Tison and Greenawalt kill the Lyonses. Their bodies were found five days later.
Then, in Colorado, police believe that on August 8 the gang murdered James Judge Jr. and his new wife, Margene. The Amarillo, Texas couple were honeymooning in southwestern Colorado at the time. (Their bodies were not found until November 1978, at a campsite near Pagosa Springs, Colorado.) The gang returned to Arizona, driving the Judges' van on Interstate 10, when they encountered a police roadblock. They ran the roadblock, and a shootout took place at a second roadblock, south of Casa Grande, Arizona.
Donald Tison, who was driving the van, was killed at the scene; the others fled on foot. Raymond, Ricky, and Greenawalt were quickly caught, but Gary Tison escaped into the desert. Over 300 police officers and hundreds of volunteers searched for him, but he eluded them.  He did not elude the August desert — he died of exposure. His body was found eleven days after the shootout.
Greenawalt and the surviving Tisons were charged with 92 crimes, including four counts of murder. (No charges were brought for the murder of the Judges, and Colorado authorities closed the cases when the surviving gang members were convicted in Arizona.)
Criminal proceedings
The two remaining Tison brothers were tried individually for capital murder in the deaths of the Lyonses. The murder charges were predicated on Arizona's felony-murder statute, which provided that killings that occurred during a robbery or kidnapping were first-degree, death-eligible murders. The Tison brothers were convicted. At a separate sentencing hearing, three aggravating factors were proved: the Tisons had created a grave risk of death to others, the murders were committed for pecuniary gain, and the murders were especially heinous, cruel, or depraved. The Arizona Supreme Court upheld the death sentences. In the intervening years, the Supreme Court decided Enmund v. Florida, leading the Tison brothers to bring a collateral attack on their sentences, claiming that Enmund required their death sentences to be struck down. The Arizona Supreme Court rejected this argument, asserting that the dictates of Enmund had been satisfied because the intent requirement of that case could be inferred from the fact that death was a foreseeable result of participating in a dangerous felony.
Holding
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, concluded that the death penalty would be appropriate for a murder like the ones the Tisons had been convicted of if it could be shown that the defendant was a major participant in the underlying felony and had acted with reckless indifference to human life. In Kennedy v. Louisiana, , the Court added with respect to the defendants in Tison it "allowed the defendants’ death sentences to stand where they did not themselves kill the victims but their involvement in the events leading up to the murders was active, recklessly indifferent, and substantial."
Later, the death penalties of Ricky and Raymond Tison were reduced to life sentences because they were both under 20 at the time of the crimes. Greenawalt was executed in 1997.
In popular media
The 1978 escape has been the subject of two films:
A Killer in the Family, a 1983 TV movie starring Robert Mitchum as Gary Tison and James Spader as his oldest son Donny. Eric Stoltz played Ricky, Lance Kerwin played Ray, and Stuart Margolin played Randy Greenawalt. 
Last Rampage, a 2017 film starring Robert Patrick as Gary Tison and Heather Graham as his wife Dorothy based on the book Last Rampage: The Escape of Gary Tison by James W. Clarke
  The story was also the subject of the Investigation Discovery series Evil Kin Season 3 eighth episode, "Road Kill."

From "Toibb v. Radloff" ==> """
Toibb v. Radloff, 501 U.S. 157 (1991), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that individuals are eligible to file for relief under the reorganization provisions of chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, even if they are not engaged in a business..   The case overturned the lower courts ruling which restricted individuals to chapter 7.  
Background
In the United States, an individual or entity may file for bankruptcy to obtain relief from debts. An individual who files for bankruptcy, known as the "debtor," may be allowed to pay as much of his or her debts as possible, under the supervision of a federal bankruptcy court. Any remaining debt is discharged, thus allowing the debtor a financial "fresh start."  
Bankruptcy cases are governed by the Bankruptcy Code, which in its current form was enacted as title 11 of the United States Code in 1978.See Pub. L. 95–598, 92 Stat. 2549 (1978). pursuant to the Bankruptcy Clause of Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.U.S. Const. art. I, § 8
The Bankruptcy Code provides for several different types of bankruptcy case, each of which is addressed in a separate "chapter" of the Code. The most common type of bankruptcy is liquidation under chapter 7 of the Code, which applies to both individual and corporate debtors. In a chapter 7 case, an individual debtor's non-exempt assets are placed into a bankruptcy estate under the control of a court-appointed trustee for distribution to creditors, and the debtor usually receives a discharge of his or her remaining debts. Alternatively, an individual who earns regular income and whose income is less than a specified annual maximum may instead choose to file a chapter 13 case, under which the individual agrees to repay all or a portion of his or her debts under a repayment plan approved by the bankruptcy court. (There is also an additional option, chapter 12, available for debtors who are farmers or fishermen.)
Another type of bankruptcy case is reorganization under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. In a chapter 11 case, unless the court orders otherwise, the debtor retains operating control of their assets as a "debtor in possession" and is allowed a period of time within which to propose a "plan of reorganization" to address creditor claims. The procedures for chapter 11 reorganization cases are complex and were widely understood to apply only to business debtors—that is, business entities such as corporations, and individuals who were the owners of a business enterprise. However, the Code did not expressly state that chapter 11 excluded individuals who were not engaged in business from filing a chapter 11 case.
Facts and procedural history
Sheldon Toibb, an individual in financial distress, filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in Missouri. Among his assets, Toibb listed stock in a corporation. The stock later turned out to be worth more than Toibb had expected. Toibb filed a motion to convert his bankruptcy case from a chapter 7 liquidation to a chapter 11 reorganization, to avoid the liquidation of the stock.
The bankruptcy court initially granted the motion, but later ordered Toibb "to show cause why his petition should not be dismissed because petitioner was not engaged in business and, therefore, did not qualify as a chapter 11 debtor."Toibb, 501 U.S. at 159. Toibb argued that he was engaged in a business, or in the alternative, that individuals who do not own businesses are also eligible for relief under Chapter 11. The bankruptcy court rejected these arguments based on Eighth Circuit precedent and Wamsganz v. Boatmen's Bank of De Soto, 804 F.2d 503 (8th Cir. 1986) held that Toibb "failed to qualify for relief under Chapter 11."
Toibb appealed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, which affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy judge. On further appeal, the Eighth Circuit also affirmed.
Toibb petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to review the Eighth Circuit's decision, based on   conflicting decisions between the Eighth Circuit, which had held that only businesses and business owners may file for chapter 11, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which had held that individuals can file under chapter 11 even if they do not own a business.See 
Opinion of the Court
Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote the opinion of the Court, speaking for eight Justices.  The Court held that nothing in the Bankruptcy Code prevents an individual debtor from filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, even if he or she is not engaged in a business.
The Court's opinion stated that in interpreting a statute, courts "look first to the statutory language and then to the legislative history if the statutory language is unclear."Toibb, 501 U.S. at 501 U.S. at 162 (quoting Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 896 (1984)). Here, the relevant statute was Section 109 of the Bankruptcy Code, which defines who may be a debtor under the different chapters or types of bankruptcy case.See 501 U.S. at 160.  Section 109(d) provides that "[o]nly a person that may be a debtor under chapter 7 of this title, except a stockbroker or a commodity broker, and a railroad may be a debtor under chapter 11 of this title." In turn, Section 109(b) provides that "[a] person may be a debtor under chapter 7 of this title" as long as the person is not a railroad, insurance company, or bank or similar financial institution.Toibb, 501 U.S. at 501 U.S. at 160 (quoting 11 U.S.C. § 109 (1988)). Nothing in the text of the Code requires that only businesses or individuals engaged in a business can file for chapter 11 reorganization. Given the great care with which Congress enumerated11 U.S.C. § 109 (1988) [See Pub. L. 95–598, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2557, as amended by Pub. L. 97–320, title VII, § 703(d), Oct. 15, 1982, 96 Stat. 1539; Pub. L. 98–353, title III, §§ 301, 425, July 10, 1984, 98 Stat. 352, 369; and Pub. L. 99–554, title II, § 253, Oct. 27, 1986, 100 Stat. 3105; and subsequently amended (after petitioner filed for bankruptcy) by Pub. L. 100–597, § 2, Nov. 3, 1988, 102 Stat. 3028; Pub. L. 103–394, title
I, § 108(a), title II, § 220, title IV, § 402, title V,

188, 193.] those who can and cannot receive protection under each chapter, the Court was "loath to infer the exclusion of certain classes of debtors from the protections of Chapter 11."Toibb, 501 U.S. at 161.
Turning to the legislative history of the then-current version of the Bankruptcy Code, the Court acknowledged that a Senate report showed that Congress anticipated that businesses would be the most common parties to file under chapter 11. However, this did not show that only businesses could permissibly file under chapter 11.Toibb, 501 U.S. at 162 (quoting S.Rep. No. 95-989, p. 3 (1978)).  Likewise, the Court considered the ultimate purposes of the various chapters of the Code, one of which is "maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate";Toibb, 501 U.S. at 163. because a chapter 11 reorganization plan must be approved by creditors or must provide that creditors "will receive not less than they would receive under a Chapter 7 liquidation,"Toibb, 501 U.S. at 164 (quoting 11 U.S.C. § 1129(a)(7) (1988)). denying chapter 11 protection to individuals would not advance Congress' overall purpose.
Finally, the Court considered the possibility that if chapter 11 were held to apply to individuals, an individual could be subjected to an involuntary chapter 11 case leading to "debt peonage," a form of involuntary servitude). (Although chapter 13 bankruptcy petitions are always voluntary, a chapter 11 case can be commenced by creditors.) However, the Court observed, if a debtor chose not to cooperate in a chapter 11 case, the bankruptcy court could simply to convert the case to a chapter 7 liquidation.
Justice Stevens' dissent
Justice Stevens dissented, acknowledging that "[t]he Court's reading of the statute is plausible," given that the statutory language does not expressly exclude non-business debtors from chapter 11 and the Senate Report language quoted in the majority opinion. Nonetheless, Stevens disagreed with the Court's conclusion, opining that chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code was intended to apply to business debtors only.
In support of his view, Stevens noted that chapter 11 is entitled "Reorganization," and that the statutory language of chapter 11 refer repeatedly to a "business."  Additionally, while section 109(d) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that only a person that may be a debtor under chapter 7 may be a debtor under chapter 11, it does not provide that all persons eligible under chapter 7 may also file under chapter 11.Toibb, 501 U.S. at 167 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
Turning to legislative history to resolve this ambiguity, Stevens agreed that the Senate Report assumes that only businesses would ever file under chapter 11. While the Senate Report does not exclude the possibility that individuals may make use of that chapter as well, it notes that the cost of filing for chapter 11 would likely prevent individuals from using it. Moreover, Justice Stevens continued, the corresponding House Report "unambiguously states that a Chapter 7 liquidation is 'the only remedy' for 'consumer debtors [who] are unable to avail themselves of the relief provided under chapter 13.'"Toibb, 501 U.S. at 168, citing "H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, p. 125 (1977). See also 124 Cong.Rec., at 32392, 32405 (Chapter 11 is 'a consolidated approach to business rehabilitation' and a 'new commercial reorganization chapter') (statement of Rep. Edwards)."
Stevens also stressed that the Code allows involuntary chapter 11 cases and that if individuals not engaged in business were subject to chapter 11, the Code does not protect them from being subject to such a filing.See Toibb, 501 U.S. at 169. For these reasons, Stevens concluded in dissent that chapter 11 should apply only to "business debtors."
Discussion
Toibb stands for the counterintuitive proposition that individuals can file for chapter 11 "reorganization" under the Bankruptcy Code.  The complexity and cost of chapter 11 bankruptcy is rather high (the case-filing fee alone is $1000).  However, a New York Times article reports that chapter 11 may be "an attractive alternative for individuals who have relatively large debts and relatively large income, or at least the expectation of future income, with which to finance a repayment plan."
Toibb has not been overruled by any subsequent decision of the Supreme Court,See  and although the Bankruptcy Code has since been amended, individuals remain eligible to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 11.See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (2005); Pub. L. No. 106-554, app. E, 114 Stat. 2763, 2763A-365 to 2763A-462 (2000).

From "Toilet Goods Ass'n, Inc. v. Gardner" ==> """
Toilet Goods Association, Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 158 (1967), was a case heard before the United States Supreme Court. It held that judicial review of a regulation's validity was inappropriate because the controversy was not ripe for adjudication. Since it was not clear whether or not an inspection would be ordered and the reasons had not been given by the Commissioner to justify his order, no primary conduct was affected and so no irremediable adverse consequences flowed from requiring a later challenge to the regulation by a manufacturer, who refused to allow inspection.
 Facts 
The Toilet Goods Association was an organization of cosmetic manufacturers accounting for 90% of annual American sales in the field.
The Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration promulgated a rule that stated, in part:
"(a) When it appears to the Commissioner that a person has:"
"(4) Refused to permit duly authorized employees of the Food and Drug Administration free access to all manufacturing facilities, processes, and the formulae involved in the manufacture of the color additives and intermediates from which such color additives are derived; he may immediately suspend certification service to such person and may continue such suspension until adequate corrective action has been taken."28 Fed. Reg. 6445-46; 21 C.F.R. § 8.28
Decision
Justice Harlan wrote, "In determining whether a challenge to an administrative regulation is ripe for review a twofold inquiry must be made: first to determine whether the issues tendered are appropriate for judicial resolution, and second to assess the hardship to the parties if judicial relief is denied at that stage."
The issues were appropriate for judicial resolution. The regulation states that the commissioner may order an inspection and that a permit may be refused.
There was no excessive hardship on the parties. Unlike in other cases, failure to comply with the rule resulted in, at most, a suspension of a certification. Fines, seizures of goods, and criminal liability were not present.

From "Tome v. United States" ==> """
Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150 (1995), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that held that under Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 801(d)(1)(B), a prior consistent statement is not hearsay only if the statement was made before the motive to fabricate arose.Mueller, Christopher and Kirkpatrick, Laird.  Evidence Under the Rules: Text, Cases, and Problems, Sixth Edition.  Aspen Publishers, New York: 2008, p. 171-72.
Factual background
The defendant, Matthew Tome, was found guilty of sexually abusing his four-year-old daughter A.T.  After her parents' divorce, A.T. was in Tome's primary physical custody, and she stayed with Tome on the Navajo Reservation in New Mexico.  A.T.'s mother lived in Colorado..
At trial, A.T. was six and a half years old and testified by short answers to leading questions.  During cross-examination, the defense suggested that A.T. had fabricated the allegations against Tome because she wanted to go live with her mother.  To rebut the charge of fabrication, the prosecution called six witnesses (a babysitter, A.T.'s mother, a social worker, and three pediatricians) that all testified to statements about the abuse that A.T. had made to them.  The trial court admitted the statements under FRE 801, which reads: 
The Tenth Circuit affirmed Tome's conviction, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.
Opinion of the Court
Majority opinion
Justice Kennedy, joined by Justices Stevens, Scalia, Souter, and Ginsburg, delivered the opinion for a majority of the court except for Part II-B, a plurality where Justice Kennedy was joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg.  The Court noted that not all prior consistent statements by a witness were excluded from the bar against hearsay evidence.  The text of FRE 801(d)(1)(B) accorded not hearsay status only to prior consistent statements by a testifying witness used to rebut a charge of recent fabrication.  The Court reasoned that to properly rebut a charge of fabrication, a prior consistent statement would need to have predated the motive to fabricate.  Otherwise prior consistent statements would be admissible to rebut other forms of impeachment, and this would ignore the common law temporal requirement that the Advisory Committee Note said was adopted by the rule.Tome, 513 U.S. at 159.
The Court found this approach consistent with the Federal Rules' liberal approach to admissibility, and rejected the Government's advocacy for a general balancing test for hearsay.Tome, 513 U.S. at 164.
In the present case, the purported motivation to fabricate arose when A.T. was put in her father's custody in 1988, before the prior consistent statements in 1990.  Finding that the statements from the other witnesses should not have been admissible under FRE 801(d)(1)(B), the Court reversed Tome's conviction and remanded the case.Tome, 513 U.S. at 167.
Plurality opinion
Part II-B represented only a plurality of Justices, and discussed how the Advisory Committee notes for the Federal Rules supported the holding.Tome, 513 U.S. at 161.
Justice Scalia's concurrence
Justice Scalia, who joined in the judgment of the Court and Kennedy's opinion except for Part II-B, wrote separately to emphasize that the Advisory Committee Notes should not be relied upon when interpreting the Federal Rules of Evidence.Tome, 513 U.S. at 168.
Justice Breyer's dissent
In a dissent joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Thomas, Justice Breyer characterized the case as one about relevance and not hearsay.  Breyer argued that the timing of the alleged motive to fabricate should go to the probative force of the testimony, not its reliability.  Breyer thought that a post-motive consistent statement could be admitted to rebut a charge of fabrication, but that the probative force of the statement would simply be diminished.  Breyer argued that FRE 801(d)(1)(B) could simply be a recognition that juries can have difficulty in separating the impeaching and substantive uses of hearsay statements, and so the rule declared as not hearsay prior consistent statements used to rebut charges of fabrication.  In that sense, the usefulness of the Rule did not rest on the majority's timing requirement.Tome, 513 U.S. at 169-76.
Subsequent history
On remand, the Tenth Circuit found that some of the hearsay admitted in the original trial was admitted erroneously under the standard enunciated by the Supreme Court.  Finding that the error was not harmless, the Tenth Circuit reversed and remanded the case.
Impact
As an interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence, Tome is not binding on state courts.Mueller & Kirkpatrick, p. 78  In states including Montana and Nebraska, courts have held that a statement fulfilling the premotive requirement of Tome are admissible as both impeachment and substantive evidence.State v. Veis, 962 P.2d 1153, 1156 (Mont. 1998)State v. Morris, 554 N.W.2d 627, 633 (Neb. 1996)
Other states including Colorado and the First Circuit have held that prior consistent statements that do not fulfill the premotive requirement of Tome may still be admitted for rehabilitative purposes.People v. Eppens, 979 P.2d 14 (Colo. 1999)

From "Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc." ==> """
Toolson v. New York Yankees, 346 U.S. 356 (1953), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld, 7–2, the antitrust exemption first granted to Major League Baseball (MLB) three decades earlier in Federal Baseball Club v. National League. It was also the first challenge to the reserve clause which prevented free agency, and one of the first cases heard and decided by the Warren Court.
Since it presumed that Congress's failure to act in the years since Federal Baseball Club was an implicit expression of intent to keep baseball exempt from the Sherman Antitrust Act, it has been read as having done more to create that exemption than the older case. Two justices (Stanley Forman Reed and Harold Hitz Burton) dissented from the short, unsigned per curiam majority opinion, arguing MLB and its revenue sources had changed enough since 1922 that the logic of that case no longer applied. In 1972, a third justice (William O. Douglas) would express his regret at having joined the majority when Toolson was again upheld in the similar Flood v. Kuhn.
 Background 
George Earl Toolson was a pitcher with the Newark Bears in 1949, a farm team for the New York Yankees in the AAA-class International League. He believed he was good enough to play in the major leagues, if not for the Yankees then for another team. But due to the reserve clause in his and every other player's contract, under which teams reserved rights to a player for a year after the contract expired, he was effectively bound to the talent-rich Yankees and could not negotiate a new contract with another team.
When the Newark franchise was dissolved prior to the 1950 season, he was demoted by the Yankees' organization to the Binghamton Triplets, an A-class team within its minor league system. He refused to report and instead filed suit, arguing the reserve clause was a restraint of trade and that baseball should not be exempt from antitrust laws.
 Baseball antitrust exemption 
In 1922, in an opinion by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., a unanimous court held in Federal Baseball Club that professional baseball did not meet the definition of interstate commerce under the Constitution and the Sherman Act because, although teams traveled between states from game to game, that travel was "incidental" to the business and not an essential aspect, since all the revenue was generated from the actual games.Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore v. National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, 259 U.S. 200 et seq., Holmes, J.
By the time Toolson filed his suit, baseball had grown greatly in popularity and as such had changed. Improved roads and public transportation meant that fans in some areas crossed state lines to attend games, and radio and television broadcasts, from which the teams derived substantial revenue, brought those games to the fans who did not leave home. The interstate aspects of the professional game had greatly increased.
In 1947, Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler was sued by former New York Giants outfielder Danny Gardella, who argued that the five-year ban Chandler imposed on players who, like Gardella, had jumped briefly to the rival Mexican League was an unfair use of monopoly power and that the Federal Baseball Club decision no longer applied. A preliminary ruling in favor of the baseball commissioner was reversed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, returning the case to the lower court for trial. In 1949, Chandler settled with Gardella for a reported $65,000. Gardella initially sought $300,000, settling for less on his lawyers' advice he would lose on appeal to the Supreme Court.
In 1951, Representative Emanuel Celler, an advocate for strong antitrust enforcement, chaired a special Judiciary Committee subcommittee on monopoly power, which had looked into baseball, among other things. Celler entered the hearings believing that MLB needed laws to support the reserve clause. Star players, such as Lou Boudreau and Pee Wee Reese, indicated their support of the reserve clause. Minor league veteran Ross Horning testified about his experiences in baseball, which he said were more common for rank-and-file players. Cy Block, who appeared briefly in the major leagues, testified about his experiences and how the reserve clause prevented him from getting an extended trial in the major leagues. Celler's final report suggested that the Congress should take no action, allowing for the matter to be settled in the federal judiciary of the United States.
 Trial and appeal 
Both the district court in Los Angeles and the Ninth Circuit relied on Federal Baseball Club in ruling for the defendants. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear it and consider a number of other cases by former Mexican League players pending at the appellate level.
Among the lawyers working on the case for baseball was Bowie Kuhn, then of the prestigious firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, who would later himself become baseball commissioner and the respondent in Flood v. Kuhn, the next case to challenge the reserve clause. When the case reached the Supreme Court, the Boston Red Sox filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the Yankees, their bitter rival.As Boston American League Base Ball Company, the team's corporate name. 349 U.S. 356. Since the Second Circuit, in reinstating Gardella's challenge, had called Federal Baseball "an impotent zombie" in light of recent Supreme Court antitrust decisions,Gardella v. Chandler, 172 F.2d 402, 408-09 (1949) (Frank, J., concurring). baseball did not expect the Court to rule in its favor.
 Opinion of the Court 
A one-paragraph unsigned per curiam opinion was followed by a longer dissent by Justice Harold Hitz Burton, joined by Stanley Forman Reed.
 Majority 
After briefly restating the conclusion of Federal Baseball Club, the majority continued:
 Dissent 
Burton listed a number of aspects of contemporary baseball—the extensive farm system, broadcasting revenues, national advertising campaigns and even its reach beyond the borders of the United States—to justify his statement that "it is a contradiction in terms to say that the defendants in the cases before us are not now engaged in interstate trade or commerce as those terms are used in the Constitution of the United States and in the Sherman Act". He also cited a report by a House subcommittee that had come to a similar conclusion.
He conceded "the major asset which baseball is to our Nation, the high place it enjoys in the hearts of our people, and the possible justification of special treatment for organized sports which are engaged in interstate trade or commerce".Id., Burton J., dissenting. But while it was certainly within Congress's power to repeal or specifically enact an antitrust exemption for baseball, it had not done so, "and no court has demonstrated the existence of an implied exemption from that Act of any sport that is so highly organized as to amount to an interstate monopoly or which restrains interstate trade or commerce". He concluded "The present popularity of organized baseball increases, rather than diminishes, the importance of its compliance with standards of reasonableness comparable with those now required by law of interstate trade or commerce."Id. at 364-65.
 Subsequent developments 
 Jurisprudence 
Within the next few terms, Toolson'''s logic was criticized directly and indirectly by other justices, including some  who had been in the majority, in dissents from opinions in which the Court held that it was specific to baseball and that even other professional sports weren't covered.
Chief Justice Earl Warren admitted, writing for the majority two years later when denying boxing the exemption, that "this Court has never before considered the antitrust status of the boxing business. Yet, if it were not for Federal Baseball and Toolson, we think that it would be too clear for dispute."United States v. International Boxing Club of New York, 348 U.S. 236, 240 (1955), Warren, C.J. Dissenters Felix Frankfurter and Sherman Minton, who were in the Toolson majority, were harshly critical. "It would baffle the subtlest ingenuity to find a single differentiating factor between other sporting exhibitions ...and baseball insofar as the conduct of the sport is relevant to the criteria or considerations by which the Sherman Law becomes applicable to a 'trade or commerce.'", the former wrote. "I cannot translate even the narrowest conception of stare decisis into the equivalent of writing into the Sherman Law an exemption of baseball to the exclusion of every other sport different not one legal jot or tittle from it."Id., 248-250, Frankfurter J., dissenting. Minton, in his dissent, added:
Another two years passed, and Radovich v. National Football League came before the Court. The circumstances of professional football at the time were almost identical to those of baseball, yet the Court ruled that the antitrust exemption was specific to the latter. Tom C. Clark, writing for a majority of six, defended the Toolson decision as preferable to the alternative: "[M]ore harm would be done in overruling Federal Baseball than in upholding a ruling which, at best, was of dubious validity"Radovich v. National Football League, 352 U.S. 445, 450, Clark, J. and admitted "were we considering the question of baseball for the first time upon a clean slate, we would have no doubts."Id. at 452.
Frankfurter again expressed his incredulity. "...[T]he most conscientious probing of the text and the interstices of the Sherman Law fails to disclose that Congress, whose will we are enforcing, excluded baseball — the conditions under which that sport is carried on — from the scope of the Sherman Law, but included football", he said.Id. at 455, Frankfurter, J., dissenting. He was joined in a separate opinion by John Marshall Harlan II signed by then-new justice William Brennan: " I am unable to distinguish football from baseball under the rationale of Federal Baseball and Toolson, and can find no basis for attributing to Congress a purpose to put baseball in a class by itself."Id. at 456, Harlan, J., dissenting.
 Flood v. Kuhn 
In 1970, St. Louis Cardinals star center fielder Curt Flood decided to refuse a trade to the Philadelphia Phillies and challenge the reserve clause again. Due to his stature as a player, his case attracted wide attention, and reached the Court in 1972. Although Flood lost, widespread support for his suit paved the way for free agency.
William O. Douglas, who had been on the Toolson majority, had ruled in a 1971 emergency appeal from a suit brought by Spencer Haywood that basketball wasn't exempt, either, and suggested he was reconsidering his role in Toolson: "the decision in this suit would be similar to the one on baseball's reserve clause which our decisions exempting baseball from the antitrust laws have foreclosed."Haywood v. Nat'l Basketball Assn., 401 U.S. 1204, 1205, Douglas, J. The following year he was the only justice from the Toolson court still sitting when Flood v. Kuhn was heard, and made his change of mind explicit in a footnote to his dissent: "While I joined the Court's opinion in Toolson ... I have lived to regret it; and I would now correct what I believe to be its fundamental error."Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258, 286n1, Douglas, J., dissenting.
In that case's majority opinion, Harry Blackmun conceded that the facts no longer supported the exemption and that baseball was indeed interstate commerce,Id., at 282-284, Blackmun, J. but echoed Clark in suggesting that the consequences of overturning the previous decisions would be worse than letting it stand. Chief Justice Warren Burger agreed in a short concurrence that also indicated his acceptance of Douglas's regret.Id. at 285-86, Burger, C.J., concurring.
 Legal analysis and criticism 
Sports business historian Andrew Zimbalist attributes the unexpected outcome to "a game of cat and mouse" between Congress and the Court:
Much of the criticism of Toolson over the years has viewed it as the middle term of the sequence that begins with Federal Baseball Club and ends with Flood, and considers it in that context. Its embrace of stare decisis and presumption of congressional inaction as a justification, is notably at odds with the position that Justice Felix Frankfurter took when writing for the Court in a 1940 trust-law case, Helvering v. Hallock, where prior flawed decisions had not been corrected through legislative action, that "it would require very persuasive circumstances enveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from re-examining its own doctrines"Helvering v. Hallock, .
One critic, antitrust expert Kevin McDonald of Jones Day, singles out the 1953 case for having truly created the antitrust exemption by reading congressional intent into Holmes' original opinion. After quoting the per curiam's closing sentence, he writes:
Lower courts, he said, took the court's reasoning to mean that other professional team sports were also exempt, forcing the justices to clarify that it only applied to baseball, and criticize their earlier ruling, in order to sustain decisions that football and boxing were interstate commerce and within the scope of antitrust law.Ibid., 8.
 Effect on baseball 
Toolson's career was over, and MLB resumed its status quo ante''. But the underlying issues remained, and a decade later began to be addressed when players unionized as the Major League Baseball Players Association, with free agency one of many goals.
Two years later, baseball held its first amateur draft, ending the system whereby wealthier and successful teams like the Yankees were able to keep their farm teams stocked with talent the way they had with Toolson, not only as insurance against player injuries but to prevent opposing teams from signing them. That ended the continuous domination of the Yankees.
Despite legal and judicial criticism and embarrassment, baseball's antitrust exemption remains in effect. Players in the major leagues won free agency with the Seitz decision in 1975, and the 1998 Curt Flood Act gave major league players, but not others involved in baseball, rights under the antitrust laws.Pub. L. 105-297, 112 Stat. 2824https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-105publ297/pdf/PLAW-105publ297.pdf   But for players in the minor leagues, like Toolson, the reserve system persists, and they are still bound to the organization that initially signed them.

From "Torcaso v. Watkins" ==> """
Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488 (1961), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court reaffirmed that the United States Constitution prohibits states and the federal government from requiring any kind of religious test for public office, in this specific case as a notary public.
Background
In the early 1960s, the Governor of Maryland appointed Roy Torcaso (November 13, 1910 – June 9, 2007). as a notary public. At the time, the Constitution of Maryland required "a declaration of belief in the existence of God" for a person to hold "any office of profit or trust in this State".Constitution of Maryland, Article 37.
Torcaso, an atheist, refused to make such a statement, and his appointment was consequently revoked. Torcaso, believing his constitutional rights to freedom of religious expression had been infringed, filed suit in a Maryland Circuit Court, only to be rebuffed. The Circuit Court rejected his claim, and the Maryland Court of Appeals held that the requirement in the Maryland Constitution for a declaration of belief in God as a qualification for office was self-executing and did not require any implementing legislation to be enacted by the state legislature.
The Court of Appeals justified its decision thus:
Torcaso took the matter to the United States Supreme Court, where it was heard on April 24, 1961.
Decision
The Court unanimously found that Maryland's requirement for a person holding public office to state a belief in God violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.
The Court had established in Everson v. Board of Education (1947):
Writing for the Court, Justice Hugo Black recalled Everson v. Board of Education and explicitly linked Torcaso v. Watkins to its conclusions:
Rebuffing the judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals, Justice Black added: "The fact, however, that a person is not compelled to hold public office cannot possibly be an excuse for barring him from office by state-imposed criteria forbidden by the Constitution."
The Court did not base its holding on the no religious test clause of Article VI. In Footnote 1 of the opinion, Justice Black wrote:
Secular humanism as a religion
Some religious groups have occasionally argued that, in Torcaso v. Watkins, the Supreme Court "found" secular humanism to be a religion. This assertion is based on a reference, by Justice Black in footnote number 11 of the Court's finding, to court cases where organized groups of self-identified humanists, or ethicists, meeting on a regular basis to share and celebrate their beliefs, have been granted religious-based tax exemptions. Religious groups such as those supporting causes such as teaching creationism in schools have seized upon Justice Black's use of the term "secular humanism" in his footnote as a "finding" that any secular or evolution-based activity is a religion under US law.; .

From "Torres v. Madrid" ==> """
Torres v. Madrid, 592 U.S. ___ (2021), was a United States Supreme Court case based on what constitutes a "seizure" in the context of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, in the immediate case, in the situation where law enforcement had attempted to use physical force to stop a suspect but failed to do so. The Court ruled in a 5–3 decision that the use of physical force with the intent to restrain a person, even if that fails to restrain the person, is considered a seizure.
Background
In July 2014, police officers were on a stakeout of an apartment complex in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to serve a warrant to a person known to be living there. Roxanne Torres had driven to the complex to drop off a passenger. At the time, she was under the influence of methamphetamines, and had been for two days. Two of the officers approached her car as a possible person of interest, and gave her instructions to get out of the car or allow them to open the doors. However, as it was dark, and both officers were in darker clothing and tactical vests, though still wore police badges, Torres mistook their orders as a possible carjacking and began to set the car in motion. The officers believed she was driving towards them, and fired multiple shots into the vehicle. Torres was hit multiple times but continued to drive the car off and away from the officers, evading any immediate pursuit, and eventually to a hospital to be treated. Having an outstanding warrant herself, she provided a false name on admittance before she was arrested.
Several legal actions followed. Torres pleaded no contest in 2015 to several counts including evading a law enforcement officer and assault on an officer. The district attorney's office reviewed the case and declined to file any charges against the officers as body cam footage showed both wore the identification identifying them as officers.
Torres filed a civil action against the officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, asserting that the officers' use of gunfire was "excessive force" under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Torres argued that the officers' actions prior to her trying to move the car amounted to an arrest and seizure, and thus the use of gunfire to stop her was unreasonable at that point. The district court judge concluded that in the situation at hand, Torres had never been arrested or seized by the officers so the Fourth Amendment rights did not apply as they never had physical control of Torres. As all other actions that officers took fell within qualified immunity, the District Court granted summary judgement to the officers. Torres appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. The Tenth Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgement, in that Torres was never arrested or seized, and thus has no Fourth Amendment claim.
Supreme Court
Torres petitioned to the Supreme Court on the question whether the unsuccessful attempt to detain her was considered a "seizure" within context of the Fourth Amendment. The petition argued that the Tenth Circuit's decision was at odds with California v. Hodari D., the prevailing standard for what constitutes a "seizure",. and with precedence of three other Circuit Courts. The Supreme Court certified the case in December 2019 to be heard prior to June 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was pushed to be heard on October 14, 2020.
Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate on the case, as at the time the case was argued she had yet to be confirmed to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg following her death.
The Supreme Court issued its decision on March 25, 2021. The 5–3 majority opinion reversed the Tenth Circuit's ruling and remanded the case for further review. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Brett Kavanaugh. Roberts wrote in his opinion, "The officers' shooting applied physical force to her body and objectively manifested an intent to restrain her from driving away. We therefore conclude that the officers seized Torres for the instant that the bullets struck her."
Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the dissenting opinion that was joined by Justices  Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Gorsuch wrote "The majority's need to resort to such a schizophrenic reading of the word 'seizure' should be a signal that something has gone seriously wrong. Today, for the first time, the majority seeks to equate seizures and criminal arrests with mere touches, attempted seizures and batteries."

From "Torres v. Puerto Rico" ==> """
Torres v. Puerto Rico, 442 U.S. 465 (1979), was a United States Supreme Court case holding that the Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure applies to Puerto Rico.. 
Facts
In 1975, Puerto Rico had passed a law authorizing police to search luggage of passengers arriving from the mainland United States:
Terry Torres, a resident of Florida, flew from Miami to San Juan.  Upon arriving at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (then known as Isla Verde Airport) in San Juan, police officers noticed that Torres was nervous.  Pursuant to Public Law 22, they searched his bags and discovered an ounce of marijuana and $250,000 in cash.  After a conviction in a criminal trial, he was sentenced one to three years' imprisonment.
Supreme Court of Puerto Rico
Torres appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, where he alleged that Public Law 22 violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement officials.  Public Law 22 as written did not require that police show probable cause before initiating a search or seizure.
Only seven of the eight justices of the Court heard the appeal.  Four justices argued that Public Law 22 was unconstitutional, while three would have held that it was constitutional; there was thus no majority opinion of the court.  But under Article V, § 4 of the Constitution of Puerto Rico, a majority was required to hold any law unconstitutional.  Thus the plurality opinion was not controlling, and the conviction of the lower court was affirmed.
U.S. Supreme Court
On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court held the law unconstitutional. In the Opinion of the Court, authored by Chief Justice Burger, the substance of the Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures was held to apply in full force to Puerto Rico.
Although the Insular Cases had established that the Constitution does not wholly apply to territories, Burger cited Mullaney v. Anderson, , for the proposition that the Congress had the authority to extend greater constitutional protections to a territory than would otherwise apply. The Congress had, in 1952, authorized Puerto Rico to write its own constitution, which included language identical to the Fourth Amendment. Burger also noted that the Court had applied other federal constitutional protections, such as free speech and due process, to Puerto Rico.  Burger's opinion leaves explicitly undecided whether the Fourth Amendment here applied directly, or through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Here, the fact that a federal guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure existed was crucial. If the guarantee had been only under the Puerto Rican Constitution, there would have been no federal question, and thus no jurisdiction in the US Supreme Court.
Having found the protection against unreasonable search and seizure applicable, Burger held that Public Law 22 was facially unconstitutional. It did not require probable cause before a search was initiated. The Court then dismissed Puerto Rico's contention that probable cause was not required because the search was conducted at an airport and on an island, where the border was international except as to United States citizens. Burger noted that both Hawaii and Alaska, which were states, were also geographically isolated from the rest of the United States, but only federal officials were authorized to make searches—and then only of international travelers. This authority to search was derived from inherent sovereign authority to control who comes and goes into the country, but Puerto Rico lacked such sovereign authority, just as would a state.
In a brief concurrence in the judgment, Justice Brennan argued that any implicit limits from the Insular Cases on the basic rights granted by the Constitution (including especially the Bill of Rights) were anachronistic in the 1970s.

From "Torres v. Texas Department of Public Safety" ==> """
Torres v. Texas Department of Public Safety, 597 U.S. ___ (2022), was a United States Supreme Court case dealing with the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) and state sovereign immunity. In a 5–4 decision issued in June 2022, the Court ruled that state sovereign immunity does not prevent states from being sued under federal law related to the nation's defense.
 Background 
The Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act of 1994 was passed to assure that personnel in the U.S. military would be able to return to work at their former employer after deployment in the field. Should the person not be able to return to work in the same position, the employer must find a position "that provides similar status and pay". USERRA applies to all employers within the United States. The law was passed to prevent employers from discriminating based on military service.
Le Roy Torres, the petitioner in the case, had been working as a trooper in the Texas Highway Patrol, a division under the Texas Department of Public Safety, when he was called to deploy in Iraq in 2007 as part of his enlistment in the Army Reserve. When he returned, he had suffered lung damage from smoke inhalation at burn pits, and could not serve in the same position. He asked the Department for a similar position within the Highway Patrol but was denied any accommodation. Torres opted to resign and later sued the Department under USERRA. The Department argued that the state could not be sued under a federal law under the principle of state sovereign immunity. Both a Texas trial court and court of appeals agreed with the state's position, dismissing Torres' suit. The Supreme Court of Texas denied review.
 Supreme Court 
The Supreme Court granted certiorari in December 2021, and heard oral arguments on March 29, 2022.
On June 29, 2022, the court reversed the Texas court of appeals in a 5–4 vote and remanded the case for further review. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion, which held that while states have sovereign immunity, it does not extend to areas of the nation's defense, and thus the state could be held liable for failing to follow USERRA, allowing Torres' lawsuit to proceed. Breyer wrote "Text, history and precedent show that the states, in coming together to form a union, agreed to sacrifice their sovereign immunity for the good of the common defense." Breyer quoted examples from 1872 onward that demonstrate that "Congress may legislate at the expense of traditional state sovereignty to raise and support the Armed Forces."
Justice Kagan wrote a concurrence that stated that in regards to state sovereign immunity, "our sovereign immunity decisions have not followed a straight line", though agreed that forgoing sovereign immunity was necessary for supporting the war powers of the nation.
Justice Clarence Thomas dissented. Thomas stated that "the ‘history, practice, precedent and the structure of the Constitution’ all demonstrate that states did not surrender their sovereign immunity in their own courts when Congress legislates pursuant to one of its war power". Thomas referred to the decision in Alden v. Maine which found that private citizens could not sue states under federal law, quoting Alden in that "the powers delegated to Congress under Article I of the United States Constitution do not include the power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits for damages in state courts".
The majority opinion in this case was the last opinion written by Justice Breyer before his retirement on June 30.

From "Tory v. Cochran" ==> """
Tory v. Cochran, 544 U.S. 734 (2005), is a United States Supreme Court case involving libel.
Background
The case began in California with Johnnie Cochran, the famed attorney who represented O. J. Simpson, suing his former client Ulysses Tory for libel and invasion of privacy. Cochran had withdrawn as Tory's lawyer in a civil rights suit nearly twenty years earlier, and in the late 1990s Tory began picketing Cochran's office, carrying signs that accused him of being a thief and of accepting bribes. A trial judge ruled that Tory had made false and defamatory statements about Cochran, and instead of awarding him damages, issued an injunction ordering Tory to never again display a sign or speak about Cochran.
Tory appealed, arguing that the order was a prior restraint that violated his First Amendment right to free speech. In an unpublished opinion, the California Court of Appeals ruled that the order was constitutional. The California Supreme Court declined to review the case, and on April 24, 2004, Tory filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. The petition was granted, briefing followed, and the oral argument took place on March 22, 2005. Cochran died seven days later and the court asked for further briefing.
Opinion of the Court
On May 31, 2005, the court ruled 7–2 that in light of Cochran's death, the injunction limiting the demonstrations of Ulysses Tory "amounts to an overly broad prior restraint upon speech". Two justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, said that Cochran's death made it unnecessary for the court to rule.

From "Totten v. United States" ==> """
Totten v. United States, 92 U.S. 105 (1876), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the court ruled on judicial jurisdiction in espionage cases., ("It may be stated as a general principle, that public policy forbids the maintenance of any suit in a court of justice, the trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential, and respecting which it will not allow the confidence to be violated.") The case was an important precursor to the court's 1953 decision in United States v. Reynolds wherein it recognized the State Secrets Privilege. The case was later referenced and its holding expanded by the Court in the 2005 case of Tenet v. Doe and then again in General Dynamics Corp. v. United States. In Tenet, which involved a contract claim against the CIA brought by Cold War era spies, Court clarified that “Totten precludes judicial review in cases . . . where success depends upon the existence of their secret espionage relationship with the government.”. In General Dynamics, the Court held that the same logic applied outside the espionage context, with the limitation that “[b]oth parties—the government no less than petitioners—must have assumed the risk that state secrets would prevent the adjudication of claims of inadequate performance.".
Overview
William Alvin Lloyd was employed as a Union spy by President Abraham Lincoln. Lloyd claimed that he was to be paid $200 per month but was ultimately only reimbursed for expenses incurred in the course of his service.92 U.S. at 106. After his death, Lloyd's estate, represented by its executor Enoch Totten, filed suit to recover the promised wages. The United States Court of Claims found as a factual matter that Lloyd had proceeded under contract as a spy but the court was equally divided on whether the President of the United States could unilaterally bind the government to such a contract and opted to dismiss the claim. The Supreme Court took the case and affirmed the lower court's dismissal on the basis that certain secret contracts could not be publicly reviewed by courts.92 U.S. at 107.
Issues
May a federal court review questions of law related to secret spy contracts, or is such review precluded by some form of executive privilege or the law of contracts?92 U.S. 105.
Holding
The court deemed that an oral contract between a deceased spy and President Lincoln was unenforceable because the very process of consideration in a court might do harm by making public the details of a secret enterprise. 
Writing for the majority, Justice Field held: 
[P]ublic policy forbids the maintenance of any suit in a court of justice, the trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential, and respecting which it will not allow the confidence to be violated. . . . Much greater reason exists for the application of the principle to cases of contract for secret services with the government, as the existence of a contract of that kind is itself a fact not to be disclosed.
Judgment affirmed.92 U.S. at 106-07.
Facts and background
In July 1861, in the midst of the American Civil War, William Alvin Lloyd was allegedly recruited as a Union spy by President Abraham Lincoln. His mission was to collect intelligence on the movements and positioning of Confederate States of America troops and other information useful to the Union war effort.92 U.S. at 105-06. Lloyd entered the Confederacy on July 16, 1861, at Memphis, Tennessee and was almost immediately jailed for an unrelated crime. Within a day or two he had bought his way out and over the course of the war spent time in Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, and Louisiana.
Although the exact details of the employment contract were disputed—and the only other party, President Lincoln, had been assassinated—Lloyd claimed that he was to be paid $200 per month for his service, which would have totaled $9,753.32 by the end of the war. But rather than paying him in full, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton agreed to reimburse Lloyd only for expenses incurred in the course of his service, totaling $2,380. After his death, Lloyd's estate, represented by its executor Enoch Totten, filed suit to recover the promised wages.
By the time the suit was filed both Lloyd and President Lincoln, the only two parties to the original oral contract, had died. There was thus little substantive evidence of the original contract upon which decide the case. Nevertheless, the United States Court of Claims found as a factual matter that Lloyd had proceeded to the Confederate States under contract to spy on President Lincoln's behalf. But the court was equally divided on whether the President of the United States had the authority to unilaterally bind the government to such a contract and opted to dismiss the claim.
The Supreme Court took Totten's appeal.
Opinion
thumb|The Waite Court in 1876.
In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Stephen J. Field, the Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Claims's dismissal of the case. "It may be stated as a general principle," wrote Justice Field, "that public policy forbids the maintenance of any suit in a court of justice, the trial of which would inevitably lead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential, and respecting which it will not allow the confidence to be violated." Citing a number of well-established evidentiary privileges such as those given to communications between spouses, clients and their attorneys, and penitents and clergy, the Court concluded that "[m]uch greater reason exists for the application of the principle to cases of contract for secret services with the government, as the existence of a contract of that kind is itself a fact not to be disclosed."
Significance
Legal historians have identified Totten as an early expression of the State Secrets Privilege later formally adopted by the Supreme Court in United States v. Reynolds. There is one important distinction, however, between the State Secrets Privilege as endorsed by the Supreme Court in United States v. Reynolds and the privilege applied in Totten: under the Reynolds privilege, individual pieces of evidence may be excluded from the record at the government's behest, but the stronger Totten form of the privilege compels dismissal of entire cases where their subject matter is claimed to be too secret for proceedings in open court. This so-called "Totten Bar" to jurisdiction has been controversial, because rather than eliminating access to particular evidence it often results in dismissal without recourse. Nevertheless, the privileges described and applied in Reynolds and Totten are often understood as two related varieties of the same general privilege.
The precise scope of Totten'''s holding was unclear until 2005. Before the Supreme Court decided Tenet v. Doe in 2005, it appeared that the reasoning of the Totten court might be confined to cases involving espionage where a plaintiff has voluntarily agreed to secrecy and thus contracted away their right to sue.92 U.S. at 106-07 ("The service stipulated by the contract was a secret service; the information sought was to be obtained clandestinely, and was to be communicated privately; the employment and the service were to be equally concealed. . . . The secrecy which such contracts impose precludes any action for their enforcement. The publicity produced by an action would itself be a breach of a contract of that kind, and thus defeat a recovery.") But Tenet clarified that “Totten precludes judicial review in cases . . . where success depends upon the existence of their secret espionage relationship with the government.” Then, finally, General Dynamics Corp. v. United States held that the same logic applies even outside the espionage context, so long as “[b]oth parties—the government no less than petitioners—must have assumed the risk that state secrets would prevent the adjudication of claims of inadequate performance."

From "Town of Greece v. Galloway" ==> """
Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.S. 565 (2014), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the court decided that the Town of Greece, New York may permit volunteer chaplains to open each legislative session with a prayer.. The plaintiffs were Susan Galloway and Linda Stephens, represented by Americans United for Separation of Church and State. They argue that the prayers violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled against the town, and on May 20, 2013 the Supreme Court agreed to rule on the issue. On May 5, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5–4 in favor of the Town of Greece, holding that the town's practice of beginning legislative sessions with prayer did not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
Question before the court
Does the town of Greece, New York, impose an impermissible establishment of religion by opening its monthly board meetings with a prayer?
Decision of the court
Majority opinion
By a 5–4 vote, the Court ruled that the town's practice did not violate the Establishment Clause. The majority opinion authored by Justice Kennedy stated: "The town of Greece does not violate the First Amendment by opening its meetings with prayer that comports with our tradition and does not coerce participation by nonadherents." The court concluded that the town's practice of opening its town board meetings with a prayer offered by members of the clergy does not violate the Establishment Clause when the practice is consistent with the tradition long followed by Congress and state legislatures, the town does not discriminate against minority faiths in determining who may offer a prayer, and the prayer does not coerce participation with non-adherents.
The majority held that sectarian prayers at government meetings are permissible under the Constitution. “To hold that invocations must be non-sectarian would force the legislatures sponsoring prayers and the courts deciding these cases to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech,” Kennedy wrote for himself and the conservative members on the court. Lawmakers and judges would otherwise have to police prayer, he wrote, involving "government in religious matters to a far greater degree than is the case under the town’s current practice of neither editing nor approving prayers in advance nor criticizing their content after the fact." This means that prayers are allowed to invoke particular religious affiliations without running afoul of the First Amendment prohibition against endorsement of religion at federal, state or local level.
Kennedy stated that U.S. Constitution doesn't require the town of Greece to search outside the town for chaplains from other faiths as long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimination. He however included a restraint on legislature prayers by stating that "[t]he purpose of legislative prayer is to lend gravity” to sessions where “the divisive business of governing” will take place. Noting that legislature prayer (in this context) should be “solemn and respectful in tone”, Kennedy went on to state that when legislative prayers are used as an opportunity to condemn or try to convert people who are not members of a particular religion, then these prayers would not conform with the Constitution. He added in general: "Absent a pattern of prayers that over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissible government purpose, a challenge based solely on the content of a particular prayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation."
Justice Kennedy wrote: “Legislative bodies do not engage in impermissible coercion merely by exposing constituents to prayer they would rather not hear and in which they need not participate.” According to the majority legislative prayers might be impermissible if they “denigrate nonbelievers or religious minorities, threaten damnation, or preach conversion,” or if the prayer giver is chosen in a religiously discriminatory way.
Concurring opinions
Justice Thomas wrote in his separate opinion (which was joined in part by Justice Scalia) that the case should be dismissed because the Establishment Clause doesn't apply to the states and its subdivisions, but only to Congress. He also stated that the Constitution would have only been violated if “actual legal coercion” like imposing taxes to pay for the church is used. Justice Alito wrote a separate concurring opinion (which was joined in part by Justice Scalia) in which he dealt with points raised by Justice Kagan in her dissent. In Alito's view “the logical thrust of many of [Justice Kagan's] arguments is that prayer is never permissible prior to meetings of local government legislative bodies.”
Dissenting opinions
Justice Breyer filed a dissent that focused on the case facts and argued that the town must do more to make its legislative prayer inclusive of other faiths.
The main dissent was authored by Justice Kagan and it was joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer and Sotomayor. Kagan noted three key differences between the case before the court and Marsh (1983): 
 The Greece Town Council is not only a legislature, but also a place where the local government interacts with the local residents.
 The prayers in Greece were not directed to lawmakers, but instead also to the local residents seeking to do business with the government.
 The prayers in Greece were sectarian in nature. 
Noting these differences, Kagan wrote: "So month in and month out for over a decade, prayers steeped in only one faith, addressed toward members of the public, commenced meetings to discuss local affairs and distribute government benefits. In my view, that practice does not square with the First Amendment’s promise that every citizen, irrespective of her religion, owns an equal share in her government." According to Kagan the providing equal treatment would have been easy: town council members could tell the chaplains that the prayers should be non-denominational, or they could have invited clergy from all different faiths to give the prayers, rather than focusing almost exclusively on Christian ministers. However, the town didn’t employ either of those measures.
Reaction to ruling
The reactions to the court's ruling were diverse. Christian conservatives and others who feel that religious expression has been overly curtailed in public settings were happy with the ruling. Eric Rassbach, deputy general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, called the court's decision "a great victory for religious liberty." Along with their supporters, the Jewish and atheist women who filed suit against the town of Greece were disappointed by the court's ruling. A number of Jewish organizations, including the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League, had filed amici curiae briefs in support of the respondents, and expressed disappointment with the majority's decision. Secular groups were also disappointed. Daniel Mach, director of the ACLU Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief, for example stated: "We are disappointed by today’s decision. Official religious favoritism should be off-limits under the Constitution. Town-sponsored sectarian prayer violates the basic rule requiring the government to stay neutral on matters of faith." Ira Lupu, a law professor emeritus at George Washington University who specializes in the First Amendment, called the court's ruling "a very bad decision" because it undermined the Establishment Clause. Lupu explained that the court decision "does not insist on any [...] reasonable effort to make prayer nonsectarian or to push for diversity. The majority faith in a particular community can dictate the prayers and minority faiths could be left out if they don’t step up and say, ‘Hey, what about us?'"
The Los Angeles Times pointed out that the decision divided the justices along religious lines, as well as ideological ones. All five justices in the majority were Catholics, and three out of the four dissenters were Jewish.
Constitutional prescription for legislative prayers
According to Lyle Denniston the constitutional prescription for legislative prayers is based on eight factors. These factors are:
 Legislative prayers are not confined to meetings of Congress or state legislatures, but may also be recited in the more intimate and familiar setting of local government meetings.
 The prayer portion of the meeting must be conducted only during a ceremonial part of the government body’s session, not mixed in with action on official policy.
 The body may invite anyone in the community to give a prayer and (if it has the money) could have a paid chaplain. The officials on the body may also join in the prayer by bowing their heads or showing other signs of religious devotion, such as crossing themselves.
 The body may not dictate what is in the prayers and what may not be in the prayers. A prayer may invoke the deity or deities of a given faith, and need not embrace the beliefs of multiple or all faiths.
 In allowing “sectarian” prayers, the body’s members may not “proselytize” i.e. promoting one faith as the true faith, and may not require persons of different faith preferences, or of no faith, to take part, and may not criticize them if they do not take part.
 The “sectarian” prayers may not disparage or discriminate against a specific faith, but officials need not go to extra lengths to make sure that all faiths do get represented in the prayer sessions — even if that means one faith winds up as the dominant message.
 Such prayers are permissible when most, if not all, of the audience is made up of adults.
 A court, in hearing a challenge to a prayer practice, is confined to examining “a pattern of prayers,” and does not have the authority to second-guess the content of individual prayer utterances. In judging such a pattern, the proper test is not whether it tends to put forth predominantly the beliefs of one faith, but whether it has the effect of coercing individuals who do not share that faith.

From "Townsend v. Sain" ==> """
Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293 (1963), was a United States Supreme Court case wherein the Court expanded the circumstances in which federal courts should hold evidentiary hearings when presented with petitions for habeas corpus by state prisoners following denial of postconviction relief in state court. The Court held that federal district courts must hold evidentiary hearings if the state court did not resolve all material factual disputes in a full and fair hearing supported by the record.
The case centered around Charles Townsend, who was convicted of a series of murders and robberies and sentenced to death. The issue heard in the Supreme Court centered around a confession Townsend had given while under the influence of an alleged "truth serum". Townsend's attorneys argued that the effects of the truth serum had made the confession inadmissible. Townsend appealed the case by filing a writ of habeas corpus against Sheriff Frank G. Sain of Cook County, Illinois. The case made it to Illinois Supreme Court once, and the Supreme Court twice: first in 1959 and again in 1963. The appeals case however did not revolve around the truth serum, but instead procedural questions surrounding a prisoner's right to an evidentiary hearing during the appeal process. 
The court held that Townsend's writ of habeas corpus should not have been summarily denied, and that the lower court should have held an evidentiary hearing to determine the veracity of Townsend's claims. The court repeated its previous decision that coerced confessions were inadmissible, and theorized that a confession via truth serum would thus be inadmissible; the court was careful to avoid saying whether or not Townsend had actually been given a truth serum.
Alongside Fay v. Noia and Sanders v. United States, Townsend is cited as revolutionizing and greatly expanding the use of habeas corpus, leading to it being used as a general purpose appeals tool. However a variety of Supreme Court decisions since then have narrowed its application.
 Background 
On December 18, 1953, steelworker Jack Boone was robbed and murdered in Chicago. Police arrested Charles Townsend on January 1, 1954. He was charged on the information of Vincent Campbell. Campbell claimed that he saw Townsend near the scene of the attack, but otherwise little physical evidence linked Townsend to the crime. Townsend was an admitted drug addict, after his arrest he began suffering from symptoms of withdrawal. During his questioning he was attended by a doctor who gave him two drugs to help the withdrawal symptoms: Phenobarbital and Hyoscine. Afterward he confessed to the murder of Boone, agreeing that he had robbed him in order to fund his drug habit. Townsend later claimed that the Hyoscine was a "truth serum" and that his confession was made while he was under its influence, thus making it inadmissible..  The police did not seem to know that Townsend had been given Hyoscine.
 Case 
The original case went to trial in 1955, where Townsend was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. During the trial, the prosecution brought in the confession of Townsend that had been given while in police custody and suffering from withdrawal. Townsend, via his public defender, objected. Outside the presence of the jury, the court held an evidentiary hearing. Townsend claimed that he had been given a truth serum while being questioned by the police. As a result, he argued any confession gained during the interrogation was inadmissible. However the court denied Townsend an ability to present evidence of such and allowed the confession to be entered. Townsend was subsequently convicted, he would appeal the case repeatedly. The case, as People v. Townsend, eventually made it to the Supreme Court of Illinois, which affirmed the conviction.
At this point Townsend was now in jail, and as a prisoner filed a writ of habeas corpus against his jailers, Sheriff Frank G. Sain of Cook County and Jack Johnson, Warden of the Cook County Jail. The case made it to the Supreme Court in 1959. At major issue through every stage of the appeal was whether the confession had been voluntary. The defense argued that it was not, and that the lower courts should have allowed the defense to make that argument, yet disallowed it. The defense argued that although Hyoscine had not been administered with the intent of being used as a truth serum, its unintended effects made it a truth serum by default. Furthermore, they argued that the police had used the drug as leverage and had verbally and physically coerced Townsend. The defense also contended, with the testimony of an expert pharmacologist, that the administration of Hyoscine would have confused Townsend as well as make him extremely tired for the entirety of the confession, as well as the following morning when he signed his confession. The judgement was vacated by the Supreme Court in 1959 without argument, and the case was remanded back to the lower courts.. However the case once again made it to the high court, where it now had a significant legal question which the court allowed for argument in October 1961. However, due to the absence of two justices, the case was reheard in October 1962.
The Supreme court ruled in 1963 that since the state court had not given Townsend's claims a proper hearing, the appellate court ought to have. Since the appellate court had failed to do so, the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the district court for a new hearing. The courts decision cemented that the federal court ought have decided what weight to give the habeas corpus hearing, since such hearings are often critical to a prisoners claim. The court also gave appellate courts the power to retry facts, especially if the defendant did not receive a "full and fair" evidentiary hearing previously. The court's 5-4 split on the issue stemmed from issues of how mandatory a rehearing at the appellate level should be. The Court decided that there were six situations in which a court had to give the prisoner a new hearing. The dissenting minority of the court argued that appeals courts should have greater discretion in hearings, and should not be forced to hold hearings. The court clarified that very few circumstances would deny a prisoners right to a fair evidentiary hearing at the appellate level, and that only a "deliberate bypass" of the state courts would qualify. Incompetence or negligence by the prisoner's lawyer would not affect how they were treated at the appellate level or disqualify them from a new evidentiary hearing. Additionally the court noted that the medical expert for the prosecution had made a mistake by not noting in layman's terms the fact that Hyoscine could possibly act as a truth serum.
The court also confirmed that a confession is inadmissible if it has been coerced from an individual, or if it was "not the product of a rational intellect and a free will". The court thus surmised that a confession taken under the influence of a supposed truth serum would meet those criteria. However the court was careful to avoid actually determining whether the drug in question was in fact a truth serum, or if the confession had been the result of it.
 Legacy 
In 1966, responding to the decision of the Court, Congress amended the judicial code with a modified version of the habeas corpus criteria formulated in Townsend. The amendments specified eight circumstances in which the finding of a lower court cannot be presumed and the court must give an evidentiary hearing. They differed in writing and number from the only six cases identified by Justice Warren. However, in cases outside of the eight specified, the burden of proof falls back on the habeas corpus petitioner to show that court fact findings were in error.
Townsend is discussed in Colorado v. Connelly (which set the modern standard for the voluntariness of confessions). Chief Justice Rehnquist called the actions "police wrongdoing", and insinuated that the police knew about the drug and its effects. Commentators Bloom and Brodin suggest this is a "revisionist reading" since the officers apparently did not know about the administration of drugs to Townsend.
The Supreme Court heard Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U.S. 1, in 1992, which modified the decision in Townsend that a prisoner is entitled to a new evidentiary hearing in all but intentional bypassing of the state courts. Instead Keeney established that prisoners must show cause, and that negligence on the part of the attorney could now be considered as a factor in denying habeas corpus. The decision was part of an attempt to streamline the overburdened appeals process, since at the time more than 10,000 habeas corpus requests were filed every year, accounting for almost 5% of all civil cases in federal court. The Supreme Court argued that giving a new evidentiary hearing to every prisoner was overkill, and wasted time and valuable court resources. As a result, only cases in which the prisoner had a legitimate cause would be entitled to new hearings.

From "Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams" ==> """
Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States interpreted the meaning of  the phrase "substantially impairs" as used in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. It reversed the decision by the Court of Appeals to grant a partial summary judgment in favor of the respondent, Ella Williams, that had qualified her inability to perform manual job-related tasks as a disability.. 
Facts of case
The respondent, Ella Williams, an automobile assembly line worker, was first employed by the petitioner, Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc., at Toyota's automobile manufacturing plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, in 1990, where she worked on an assembly line using pneumatic tools. Eventually she began to experience pain in her hands, wrists and arms, for which she sought treatment and was diagnosed with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and bilateral tendinitis. Her personal physician placed her on certain restrictions regarding her movements, and Toyota assigned her to various alternative jobs to accommodate her limitations. When Williams missed work for medical reasons due to job-related tasks, she filed a claim under the Kentucky Workers’ Compensation Act. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §342.0011 et seq. (1997 and Supp. 2000). This claim was settled between the parties, and Williams returned to work. However, she remained dissatisfied with Toyota's efforts to accommodate her work restrictions and brought an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky claiming that Toyota had refused to accommodate her disability, a suit that was again settled, and she returned to work as a Quality Control Inspection Operations (QCIO) worker which involved the visual inspection of vehicles. Both parties agreed that she was able to perform these duties satisfactorily. However, in the fall of 1996, the job duties changed and Williams was required to perform some additional physical tasks, which caused Williams difficulty.
Although the parties disagree on the facts from this point on, in any case Williams was restricted by her physician from work of any kind; she was fired and eventually she sued her former employer for failing to  accommodate her disability reasonably and for terminating her employment.
Legal history
Williams claimed to be disabled and unable to perform her job at Toyota because of carpal tunnel syndrome and related problems. She successfully sued  Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. for failure to provide "reasonable accommodations" as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §12112(b)(5)(A).. Upon Toyota's appeal, the District Court issued a summary judgment that the Williams' impairment did not qualify as a "disability" under the ADA because her disability did not "substantially limit" any "major life activity" §12102(2)(A),. and that there was no evidence that she possessed  a record of such  disabilities.
Under ADA, a "major life activity" includes actions of daily living such as "walking, seeing, hearing, learning, and working", not limitations specific to job-related tasks.
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this summary judgment, ruling  that  Williams's impairments  substantially limited her ability to perform manual tasks and considered this a limitation in a  "major life activity". To demonstrate this disability, Williams showed that her manual disability extended to a "class" of manual activities that directly related to her ability to perform specific work tasks such as repetitive activities, the gripping of certain tools, and performing tasks while in a particular posture for extended time period. The court specifically disregarded evidence that she was able to perform personal care tasks and tasks involving household chores as irrelevant to its finding. It  granted her a partial summary judgment that she was disabled under the ADA.
The case was appealed to the Supreme Court. Future Chief Justice John Roberts argued the case for petitioner Toyota.
Decision
Writing for the court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor issued the opinion.
The "major life activity" definition in evaluating the performance of  manual tasks focuses the inquiry on whether Williams was unable to perform a range of tasks central to most people in carrying out the activities of daily living. The issue is not whether Williams was unable to perform her specific job tasks. Therefore, the determination of whether an impairment rises to the level of  a disability is not limited to activities in the workplace solely, but rather to manual tasks in life in general. When the Supreme Court applied this standard, it found that the Court of Appeals had incorrectly determined the presence of a disability because it relied solely on her inability to perform specific manual work tasks which  was insufficient in proving the presence of a disability. The Court of Appeals should have taken into account the  evidence presented that Williams retained the ability  to do personal tasks and household chores, such  activities being the nature of tasks  most people do in their daily lives, and placed too much emphasis  on her job disability. Since the evidence showed that Williams was performing normal daily tasks, it ruled that the Court of Appeals erred when it found Williams to be disabled.
Therefore, the Court of Appeals’ judgment granting partial summary judgment to Williams was reversed and the case was remanded back to the District Court of Appeals for further deliberations consistent with the Supreme Court's opinion.

From "Trade-Mark Cases" ==> """
The Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82 (1879), were a set of three cases consolidated into a single appeal before the United States Supreme Court, which in 1879 unanimously ruled that the Copyright Clause of the Constitution gave Congress no power to protect or regulate trademarks.. Congress then passed the Trade Mark Act of 1881, which was based on the Commerce Clause power, and therefore passed constitutional muster.
The three cases were United States v. Steffens, United States v. Wittemann, and United States v. Johnson. Steffens and Wittemann dealt with alleged counterfeiting of marks associated with champagne, while Johnson dealt with alleged counterfeiting of a mark associated with whiskey.
The opinion was written by Justice Samuel Freeman Miller.
The Court did not exclude all possibility of Congress regulating trademarks. Congress, however, read the decision very strictly and in a new trademark law enacted in 1881 regulated only trademarks used in commerce with foreign nations, and with the Indian tribes, areas specified under the Commerce Clause. It was not until 1905 that Congress would again enact a trademark law generally governing marks in use in the United States, though the 1905 act was also carefully worded to fall within the Commerce Clause.

From "TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc." ==> """
TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc., 532 U.S. 23 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court decision in the area of trademark law, holding that a functional design could not be trademarked, and that a patented design was presumed to be functional.. 
Background
The plaintiff, Marketing Display, Inc., held patents (, ) on a two-spring design to keep traffic signs standing in strong winds. After the plaintiff's patents expired, the defendant, TrafFix Devices, Inc., began manufacturing their own signs using the design. The plaintiff sued for trade dress infringement based on copying of the recognizable design. The issue the Courts dealt with concerned the legal question of whether trade dress protection could apply to the subject of an expired patent.
Opinion of the Court
The Court, in a unanimous opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, held that there can be no trademark protection for something that is functional because that would work as a detriment to competitors based on something other than reputation, which is the key consideration in trademark law.
The Court noted that the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the characteristic for which protection is sought is not functional—but having a patent for a design raises a very strong presumption that the design was functional. A design is functional if it serves any purpose that makes the product work better, or makes the product less expensive to produce. That an alternative design is available does not undercut the functionality of a given design.Discussing trademarks, we have said “ ‘[i]n general terms, a product feature is functional,’ and cannot serve as a trademark, ‘if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article.’ ”. Expanding upon the meaning of this phrase, we have observed that a functional feature is one the “exclusive use of [which] would put competitors at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage.” . . . Where the design is functional under the Inwood formulation there is no need to proceed further to consider if there is a competitive necessity for the feature. Here, Justice Kennedy said, the design was clearly functional, and the plaintiff could not carry the burden of proving otherwise because the very characteristic that is sought to be protected by trademark is the one whose functionality was previously sought to be covered by patent.

From "Train v. City of New York" ==> """
Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35 (1975), was a statutory interpretation case in the Supreme Court of the United States..  Although one commentator characterizes the case's implications as meaning "[t]he president cannot frustrate the will of Congress by killing a program through impoundment," the Court majority itself made no categorical constitutional pronouncement about impoundment power but focused on the statute's language and legislative history. The words "Constitution," "separation of powers," "separated powers" appear nowhere in the 8-justice majority opinion. The Court's opinion approaches the case as a question of statutory interpretation, albeit one with implications for the American system of checks and balances.
In this case, President Richard Nixon was of the view that the administration was not obligated to disburse all funds allocated by Congress to states seeking federal monetary assistance under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and ordered the impoundment of substantial amounts of environmental protection funds for a program he vetoed, and which had been overridden by Congress. Russell E. Train, the administrator of the EPA at the time, complied with the order. Several prospective recipients of the funds (which were intended to subsidize construction of municipal sewers and water treatment works), including the city of New York and several other municipalities, promptly sued, seeking judgment that the administrator was obligated to disburse full amounts authorized and an order directing him to make those allotments.
In interpreting the statute and its key terms "sums" (not all sums) and "not to exceed," the Court declined to interpret the statute as a congressional grant of discretion to the President to order the impoundment of substantial amounts of environmental protection funds for a program in these circumstances. The Court's review of the statute's legislative history revealed no intention to grant impoundment authority.
The case arose from facts which pre-date the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, though the case was argued after the passing of the 1974 Act. The case showed that the presidential power of impoundment, even without the 1974 Act, was limited by a fair reading of the words Congress chose in its appropriation act. The President is required to carry out the full objectives or scope of programs for which budget authority is provided by the United States Congress. In this case, the President could not order the impoundment of substantial amounts of environmental protection funds for a program he had vetoed, and which Congress had overridden. This finding closed a potential loophole in the Act.

From "Train v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc." ==> """
Train v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 421 U.S. 60 (1975), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the EPA must approve a State Implementation Plan if it meets the criteria under the Clean Air Act.
Facts
The 1970 amendments to the Clean Air Act required states to meet federally mandated air quality standards within a statutorily specified period of time. States were directed to submit to the Administrator of the EPA a plan to "implement, attain and maintain" the federally adopted standards within nine months of the promulgation of such standards. The EPA Administrator was required to approve implementation plans meeting the statutory criteria and to promulgate substitutes for those found deficient. A number of states included variance procedures in their implementation plans, which the EPA approved. The NRDC challenged the EPA's approval of Georgia's implementation plan on the grounds that the postponement provision of the Clean Air Act was the only method to modify the state implementation plans. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the Georgia plan should not have been approved, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.
Opinion 
In an opinion delivered by Justice Rehnquist, the Court concluded that the Fifth Circuit erred in holding that postponements were
the exclusive means by which individual sources could obtain relief from state implementation plans. The Court held that the Fifth Circuit had improperly substituted their judgment for the agency's judgment, and the flexibility in the language of the Clean Air Act left the states with the requisite authority to grant source-specific variances. The Court further held that as long as the "ultimate effect of a State's choice of emission limitations is compliance with the national standards for ambient air," a state is "at liberty to adopt whatever mix of emission limitations it deems best suited to its particular situation."

From "Trammel v. United States" ==> """
Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40 (1980), is a United States Supreme Court case involving the spousal privilege and its application in the law of evidence. In it, the Court held that the witness-spouse alone has a privilege to refuse to testify adversely; the witness may be neither compelled to testify nor foreclosed from testifying.
In it, the court upheld the conviction of the Petitioner. Prior to presenting his case before the Supreme Court, the Petitioner was convicted of illegally smuggling heroin into the United States and conspiracy to import, based upon the testimony of his wife. The Petitioner then appealed, claiming that the admission of the adverse testimony of his wife, over his objection, contravened prior precedent and therefore constituted reversible error.
The court rejected both traditional and contemporary justifications for the traditional scope of the privilege.
In so ruling, the court held that a witness-spouse alone has a privilege to refuse to testify adversely; the witness may be neither compelled to testify nor foreclosed from testifying.
Reasoning
"(a) The modern justification for the privilege against adverse spousal testimony is its perceived role in fostering the harmony and sanctity of the marriage relationship. While this Court, in Hawkins, reaffirmed the vitality of the common law privilege in the federal courts, it made clear that its decision was not meant to 'foreclose whatever changes in the rule may eventually be dictated by reason and experience.'" 358 U.S. at 358 U. S. 79.
"(b) Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence acknowledges the federal courts' authority to continue the evolutionary development of testimonial privileges in federal criminal trials 'governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted . . . in the light of reason and experience.'"
"(c) Since 1958, when Hawkins was decided, the trend in state law has been toward divesting the accused of the privilege to bar adverse spousal testimony" [31 states recognized the privilege against adverse spousal testimony at the time of Hawkins, but at the time of this decision only 24 still did].
"(d) Information privately disclosed between husband and wife in the confidence of the marital relationship is privileged under the independent rule protecting confidential marital communications, Blau v. United States, 340 U. S. 332; and the Hawkins privilege, which sweeps more broadly than any other testimonial privilege, is not limited to confidential communications, but is invoked to also exclude evidence of criminal acts and of communications in the presence of third persons. The ancient foundations for so sweeping a privilege -- whereby a woman was regarded as a chattel and denied a separate legal identity -- have long since disappeared, and the contemporary justification for affording an accused such a privilege is unpersuasive. When one spouse is willing to testify against the other in a criminal proceeding -- whatever the motivation -- there is probably little in the way of marital harmony for the privilege to preserve. Consideration of the foundations for the privilege and its history thus shows that 'reason and experience' no longer justify so sweeping a rule as that found acceptable in Hawkins."

From "Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison" ==> """
Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison is a landmark decision on religious liberty and employment law made in 1977 by the US Supreme Court, holding that an employer may discharge an employee who observes a seventh-day sabbath, and that such employee is not entitled to equal employment opportunity protection under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the basis of his religion.
The Supreme Court agreed in 2023 to hear a case, Groff v. DeJoy, that challenges the legal precedent from TWA.
Case History
Larry Hardison was an employee at Trans World Airline. Hardison was a member of the Worldwide Church of God and refused to work on Saturdays which was his sabbath. TWA transferred his shift from night to during the day on Saturday. But he didn't keep the same seniority once he switched job roles, and therefore the union wouldn't let him have Saturdays off.  TWA refused a proposal wherein he would have worked only four days a week, and he was eventually discharged for refusing to work on Saturdays.  
 Supreme Court Decision 
The Supreme court sided with the Trans World Airlines because the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission states there needs to be “reasonable” accommodations for religious exercise.
In a widely quoted dissenting opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote "[O]ne of this Nation's pillars of strength our hospitality to religious diversity has been seriously eroded."
 Challenges to the legal precedent   
In 2020, the Supreme Court denied cert in Patterson v. Walgreen, a case that called on the Court to reconsider TWA v. Hardison precedent. Justice Alito, joined by Justices Thomas and Gorusch, wrote a statement calling for the Hardison precedent to be reconsidered in a future appropriate case:
In 2021 the high court denied certiorari in Dalberiste v. GLE Associates, Small v. Memphis Light, Gas & Water, which would have challenged the precedent.  Judge Gorsuch and Alito wrote a dissent to the denial of certiorari.
15 members of US Congress filed an amicus brief on 26 September 2022, arguing that the standard set in Hardison for "undue hardship" was irreconcilable with the text and congressional purpose of Title VII, imploring the court to grant certiorari in Groff v. DeJoy, and overturn its precedent.
The Supreme Court discussed this case in their conference on January 13, 2023, and granted certiorari.

From "TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez" ==> """
TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. ___ (2021), was a United States Supreme Court case dealing with standing under Article III of the Constitution related to class-action suits against private defendants. In a 5–4 decision, the Court ruled that only those that can show concrete harm have standing to seek damages against private defendants.
 Background 
Sergio Ramirez had been in the process of purchasing a new car in 2011 and, as typically done, had his credit rating reviewed by the dealership. Using the credit rating agency TransUnion, his name was checked not only against financial databases but alongside a list maintained by the federal Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of known terrorists and other known criminals that would be illegal to conduct business with. As his name matched one of those on the OFAC's list - but otherwise had no relation to the known criminal - the dealership told him this in front of family members and refused to sell him the car. Ramirez asked TransUnion for copies of his credit report, which still indicated that Ramirez was considered a potential criminal. Eventually, TransUnion distinguished Ramirez's credit record as unconnected to the OFAC list.
Ramirez filed suit against TransUnion in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in 2012, asserting that TransUnion's means of using simple name matching to the OFAC list violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which was created to allow victims of false credit reporting to seek remedies. Ramirez sought and obtained class-action status for his suit, with 8,184 other individuals that similarly had been matched against the OFAC list due to sharing a name and who had been notified by TransUnion. A jury trial awarded the class damages of  in 2016, though on appeal to the Ninth Circuit in 2020, the damages were reduced to . During both the jury trial and at appeal, TransUnion objected to the validity of the class-action suit under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, claiming that the class members had not shown demonstrable harm and thus lacked Article III standing to bring suit. However, the courts rejected TransUnion's argument.
 Supreme Court 
TransUnion petitioned to the Supreme Court on the question of the class standing. The Court granted certiorari for the case in December 2020, and oral arguments were held on March 20, 2021.
The Supreme Court handed down its decision on June 25, 2021. In a 5–4 decision, the Court reversed the Ninth Circuit and remanded the case for further review. The majority opinion was written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett. The majority found that of the class members, only 1,853 - those whose credit reports had been shared with third-party businesses - had shown any, physical, monetary, or various intangible harms including reputational harm to have Article III standing under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Kavanaugh wrote "Only those plaintiffs who have been concretely harmed by a defendant’s statutory violation may sue that private defendant over that violation in federal court." In addition, the court found that only Ramirez had a right to sue for damages with regard to two other claims, both stemming from allegations that TransUnion's mailings were improperly formatted, since none of the other plaintiffs had shown that they had even opened the mailings.
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent which was joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Thomas wrote that the courts had long favored injuries for violations of "private rights" that would have allowed the class-action lawsuit to proceed, but stated "Despite Congress’s judgment that such misdeeds deserve redress, the majority decides that TransUnion’s actions are so insignificant that the Constitution prohibits consumers from vindicating their rights in federal court." Justice Kagan also wrote a dissent, joined by Breyer and Sotomayor. Kagan agreed on Thomas' conclusion and that the majority opinion "transforms standing law from a doctrine of judicial modesty into a tool of judicial aggrandizement". However, Kagan stated that the Supreme Court had previously concluded in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins that one must show specific harm to have standing, though in practice, the situation would still resolve in the same manner as Thomas outlined.

From "Travelers Casualty & Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co." ==> """
Travelers Casualty & Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U.S. 443 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case about attorney's fees in bankruptcy cases. Justice Samuel Alito wrote the opinion for a unanimous court.
 Background 
Before they declared bankruptcy, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) purchased surety bonds from Travelers, an insurance company. The bonds obliged Travelers to settle debts PG&E couldn't repay. When PG&E filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on April 6, 2001 as a result of the California electricity crisis, Travelers hired attorneys to protect its interests. California law mandated that PG&E cover all attorney fees incurred by Travelers during state court proceedings. The litigation later moved to federal court, where PG&E refused to pay for Travelers' federal court expenses, claiming they were only responsible for fees incurred during state court proceedings.
 Procedural history 
The bankruptcy court denied Travelers' request for reimbursement because the federal precedents in the Ninth Circuit held that only federal laws could ensure payment for federal litigation. PG&E was only under contractual and legal obligation to pay for state-court attorney fees, not federal-court fees. The District Court and the Ninth Circuit denied Travelers' claim on the same grounds. Travelers appealed to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari, seeking to resolve an inconsistency among the circuit courts.
 Decision 
Issue
Can an unsecured creditor in a bankruptcy case collect attorneys' fees authorized by a contract and incurred in postpetition litigation where such a contractual obligation is guaranteed under a state law?
Opinion
thumb|right|200px|PG&E yard in San Francisco
Justice Alito issued the Court's unanimous opinion, holding that "an otherwise enforceable contract allocating attorney’s fees ... is allowable in bankruptcy except where the Bankruptcy Code provides otherwise." Because the Bankruptcy Code "says nothing about unsecured claims for contractual attorney's fees incurred while litigating issues of bankruptcy law," the Court could "presume that claims enforceable under applicable state law will be allowed in bankruptcy unless they are expressly disallowed."  
The Court found that none of the nine exemptions waiving contractual obligation to reimburse attorney fees set forth in 11 U.S.C. § 502(b) applied to Travelers, and therefore nothing undermined the debtor's contractual or state-law obligation to pay. The idea that state-law or contractual claims for attorneys' fees are unenforceable in federal bankruptcy proceedings, Alito wrote, "finds no support in the Bankruptcy Code, either in §502 or elsewhere."

From "Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer" ==> """
Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. ___ (2017), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a Missouri program that denied a grant to a religious school for playground resurfacing, while providing grants to similarly situated non-religious groups, violated the freedom of religion guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
Background
The original 1820 Constitution of Missouri contained a provision prohibiting tax dollars from funding the construction of churches or the salaries of ministers, in like manner to the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom.Douglas Laycock, The Supreme Court, 2016 Term — Comment: Churches, Playgrounds, Government Dollars — and Schools?, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 133 (2017).  In 1870, controversy over Catholic schools in St. Louis led Missouri to adopt a constitutional amendment prohibiting any funding of a school “controlled by any creed, church, or sectarian denomination whatever.”  In 1875, Missouri adopted a new constitution that carried forward the provision prohibiting parochial school funding, and adding a section declaring “no money shall ever be taken from the public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church, sect or denomination of religion”.Mo. Const.: art. I, § 7  In 1876, the Blaine Amendment to the United States Constitution, which sought to combat the perceived threat Catholics posed to the nation’s Protestant character by prohibiting public funding of parochial schools, failed.
Trinity Lutheran Church operates a licensed preschool and daycare in Columbia, Missouri that was initially opened as a non-profit corporation but merged with the church in 1985. The preschool and daycare has an open admissions policy and incorporates daily religious instruction into its programs. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources offers grants that provide funds for qualifying organizations to purchase recycled tires to resurface playgrounds. Trinity applied for such a grant.  The state gave out fourteen such grants that year, and graded the church's application with the fifth highest score, but denied the grant, citing the 1875 provision requiring no state aid of churches.
The church brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, arguing that the denial of its application violated the Equal Protection Clause as well as the First Amendment's protections of freedom of religion and speech.  On September 26, 2013, District Judge Nanette Kay Laughrey granted DNR Director Sarah Parker Pauly's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Trinity moved for reconsideration and to amend its complaint to include allegations that such grants had previously been given to religious organizations, which the District Court then denied.Oyez: Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer
On May 29, 2015, United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit Judge James B. Loken, joined by Judge Michael Joseph Melloy, affirmed the District Court, over the partial dissent of Judge Raymond Gruender.  On August 11, 2015, a rehearing en banc was denied by an equally divided circuit, with Judges Gruender, William J. Riley, Lavenski Smith, Steven Colloton, and Bobby Shepherd voting to review.
On January 15, 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States granted the Church's petition for a writ of certiorari, certifying the question of, "Whether the exclusion of churches from an otherwise neutral and secular aid program violates the Free Exercise Clause and the Equal Protection Clause when the state has no valid Establishment Clause concern."No. 15-577: Question Presented  Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the Court twelve days before the case was argued in April 2017.Richard W. Garnett and Jackson C. Blais, Religious Freedom and Recycled Tires: The Meaning and Implications of Trinity Lutheran, 2016–2017 Cato Sup. Ct. Rev. 105 (2017)  Six days before oral argument, Eric Greitens, Missouri’s new Republican Governor, issued a press release announcing that the DNR had been told to allow religious organizations to compete for the tire scrap grants.Office of Missouri Governor Eric Greitens (April 13, 2017): Governor Greitens Announces New Policy to Defend Religious Freedom  One day before oral argument, Josh Hawley, Missouri's new Republican Attorney General, recused himself and announced that the state's former Solicitor General would instead argue the case for the state.  On April 19, 2017, one hour of oral arguments were heard, where an attorney from the Alliance Defending Freedom appeared for the church and the former Missouri Solicitor General appeared for that state.
Opinion of the Court
On June 26, 2017, the last day of the term, the Supreme Court delivered judgment in favor of the church, with seven justices voting to reverse the court below.  Chief Justice John Roberts, in an opinion joined fully by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Samuel Alito, and Elena Kagan, and partially by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, wrote that the state violated the First Amendment by denying a public benefit to an otherwise eligible recipient solely on account of its religious status, calling it "odious to our Constitution" to exclude the church from the grant program, even though the consequences are only "a few extra scraped knees."
The Court read , in which a plurality of Justices had found that ministers could not be disqualified from becoming delegates to a state constitutional convention, as holding that special disabilities imposed due to religious status are subject to strict scrutiny.  The Court then found that Missouri's treatment of the church as a church discriminated against it due to its religious status.
The Chief Justice stopped short of a more blanket ruling, adding a footnote to clarify that the case "involves express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing" and that the Court was not addressing "religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination."Full footnote: "This case involves express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing. We do not address religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination." (Slip op. at 14) Justices Thomas and Gorsuch did not join this footnote in the opinion.
The Court noted that  upheld the state of Washington's decision not to fund students seeking degrees in devotional theology as part of a state scholarship program, but said the state did not want to force students to give up their religious views; for instance, the scholarships could be used at religious schools.  Missouri could not rely on Locke here, the Court explained, because devotional theology is an essentially religious endeavor while playground resurfacing is not.Slip Op. at 13.  While the state may discriminate against funding activities for being religious, it cannot discriminate against persons simply for being religious.  Finally, the Court found that the discrimination against the church failed strict scrutiny because Missouri did not have a compelling government interest in enforcing a stricter separation of church and state than that found already in the U.S. Constitution.
 Thomas's concurrence 
Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, concurred in part with the opinion of the Court. He joined nearly all of the opinion, but did not join footnote 3. He took issue with the Court's endorsement in Locke of even a "mild kind" of discrimination against religion, but since the Court "appropriately construes Locke narrowly," he was able to join nearly all of the opinion.
 Gorsuch's concurrence 
Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, concurred in part. He offered two qualifications: first, that "the Court leaves open the possibility a useful distinction might be drawn between laws that discriminate on the basis of religious status and religious use," and second, that footnote 3 may lead some to read that the Court's ruling applies only in cases involving a playground "or only those with some association with
children’s safety or health, or perhaps some other social good we find sufficiently worthy."
 Breyer's concurrence in judgment 
Justice Stephen Breyer concurred only in the judgment. Citing the Court's ruling in , where Justice Hugo Black wrote that depriving parochial schools from "general government services as ordinary police and fire protection...is obviously not the purpose of the First Amendment," Breyer equated Missouri's program with the general government services in Everson.
 Sotomayor's dissent 
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, read from her dissenting opinion from the bench. It took strong exception to the ruling, saying it "slights both our precedents and our history, and its reasoning weakens this country’s longstanding commitment to a separation of church and state beneficial to both." Further, "[t]he Court today profoundly changes that relationship by holding, for the first time, that the Constitution requires the government to provide public funds directly to a church."

From "Trop v. Dulles" ==> """
Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86 (1958), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to revoke citizenship as a punishment for a crime. The ruling's reference to "evolving standards of decency" is frequently cited in Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.
Background
Albert Trop was a natural born citizen of the United States who, while serving as a private in the United States Army in 1944, deserted from an Army stockade in Casablanca, Morocco. The next day, he willingly surrendered to an army officer and was taken back to the base, where he was subsequently court-martialed, found guilty, and sentenced to three years at hard labor, forfeiture of pay, and a dishonorable discharge.
In 1952, Trop applied for a passport, which was denied because the Nationality Act of 1940 provided that members of the armed forces of the United States who deserted would lose their citizenship. (A 1944 amendment modified the Act such that a deserter would lose his citizenship only if, on these grounds, he had been dishonorably discharged or dismissed from the military.)
Trop filed suit in US federal courts seeking declaratory judgment that he was a US citizen.
The US district court ruled in favor of the government, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the decision of the district court.
Representation
 Osmond K. Fraenkel argued the cause and filed the briefs for petitioner
 Oscar H. Davis argued the cause for respondents on the original argument, and Solicitor General Rankin on the reargument; with them on the briefs were Warren Olney, III (then Assistant Attorney General) and J. F. Bishop;  Beatrice Rosenberg was also with them on the brief on the re-argument
Decision
The Supreme Court reversed. In the decision, written by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the Court cited Perez v. Brownell, the Court had held that citizenship could be divested in the exercise of the foreign affairs power. However, "denationalization as a punishment is barred by the Eighth Amendment," describing it as "a form of punishment more primitive than torture" as it inflicts the "total destruction of the individual's status in organized society." Further, the Court declared that the Eighth Amendment's meaning of cruel and unusual must change over time and "must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society".
Dissenting, Justice Felix Frankfurter noted that desertion from the military can be punished by the death penalty, leading him to ask, "Is constitutional dialectic so empty of reason that it can be seriously urged that loss of citizenship is a fate worse than death?"

From "Troxel v. Granville" ==> """
Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States, citing a constitutional right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children, struck down a Washington State law that allowed any third party to petition state courts for child visitation rights over parental objections..
Background
Tommie Granville and Brad Troxel had two daughters from a relationship that ended in 1991. After their separation, Brad Troxel lived with his parents and regularly brought his daughters to his parents' home for weekend visitations. Brad Troxel died in May 1993, and in October 1993 Tommie Granville informed Brad Troxel's parents that she wished to limit visitations to once a month. The paternal grandparents petitioned to obtain visitation rights with their granddaughters. The Washington Superior Court ordered that the grandparents have visitation one weekend per month, one week during the summer, and four hours on both of the petitioning grandparents' birthdays. Granville appealed. Before addressing the merits of the case, the State Court of Appeals remanded for entry of written findings of fact and conclusions of law, citing the best interests of the children as reason for their decision. The Washington Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, dismissed the Troxels' petition, and held that the limitations on non-parental visitation were consistent with "parents' fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of their children". The Washington State Supreme Court affirmed, and the U.S. Supreme court granted certiorari.
 Plurality 
The Court held that "the interest of parents in the care, custody and control of their children—is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court."Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65. That fundamental right is implicated in grandparent visitation cases, and as such, it struck down the Washington visitation statute because it unconstitutionally infringed on the right.
State courts considering non-parent visitation petitions must apply "a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children."Troxel, 530 U.S. at 69. Troxel requires that state courts must give "special weight" to a fit parent's decision to deny non-parent visitation, as well as other decisions made by a parent regarding the care and custody of their children.
The plurality held that "choices [parents make] about the upbringing of children... are among associational rights... sheltered by the Fourteenth Amendment against the State's unwarranted usurpation, disregard, or disrespect.". This principle must inform the understanding of the "special weight" that Troxel requires courts to give to parents' decisions. Even though Troxel does not define "special weight," previous Supreme Court precedent indicates that "special weight" is a term signifying very considerable deference.See, for example, ; .
The "special weight" requirement, as illuminated by these prior Supreme Court cases, means that the deference provided to the parent's wishes will be overcome only by some compelling governmental interest and by overwhelmingly clear factual circumstances supporting that governmental interest. This is essentially identical to the strict scrutiny standard, in keeping with the fundamental status of parental rights.
Concurrences
Justice Souter questioned the Washington Supreme Court's holding, and the plurality's strong implication, that actual harm must be demonstrated before a parental decision may be questioned by a state authority, and instead argued that the statute was unconstitutional on its face due to overbreadth.
Justice Thomas applied strict scrutiny and reached the conclusion that "the State of Washington lacks even a legitimate governmental interest–to say nothing of a compelling one–in second-guessing a fit parent’s decision regarding visitation with third parties." However, Thomas questioned whether Meyer v. Nebraska and Pierce v. Society of Sisters were correctly decided, but floated the possibility that parental rights may be protected under the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment instead. Because neither party asked the Court to do so, Thomas did not reexamine the holdings of Meyer and Pierce.
 Dissent 
Justice Scalia  wrote that while the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children is among the "unalienable Rights" with which the Declaration of Independence proclaims "all men ... are endowed by their Creator," and that right is also among the unenumerated "othe[r] [rights] retained by the people" under the Ninth Amendment, parents have no enforceable rights because they are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution.
Justice Stevens' opinion stated that parents have some rights under the Constitution, but that states may infringe upon them to guarantee the child's interest in a relationship with third parties. Stevens stated that parental rights may not be exercised in a way that a state court may deem to be "arbitrary", and that the best interest of the child standard was sufficient.
Justice Kennedy likewise argued that the best interest of the child standard may be applied, but the parent's decision should be given some weight, and stated that the judgment should be vacated and remanded to the Washington courts to determine whether the factual circumstances justified overturning Granville's decision. Kennedy also raised the concern that state family court procedures may be disrupted by the Court's holding.
Legacy
The decision in Troxel v. Granville affected the interpretation of state laws granting grandparent visitation rights. The Troxel Court declined to decide whether the Due Process Clause requires nonparental visitation statutes to include a showing of harm in order to be valid, leaving the question open as to what governmental interests courts should consider in deciding if visitation is appropriate. Many states have upheld nonparental visitation statutes against Troxel challenges by distinguishing between statutes applying the "best interests" standard that gave equal weight to parental and nonparental claims and statutes that give extra weight to parental parties.

From "Trump v. Hawaii" ==> """
Trump v. Hawaii, No. 17-965, 585 U.S. ___ (2018), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case involving Presidential Proclamation 9645 signed by President Donald Trump, which restricted travel into the United States by people from several nations, or by refugees without valid travel documents. Hawaii and several other states and groups challenged the Proclamation and two predecessor executive orders also issued by Trump on statutory and constitutional grounds. Citing a variety of statements by Trump and administration officials, they argued that the proclamation and its predecessor orders were motivated by anti-Muslim animus.
A U.S. district court issued a preliminary injunction preventing the ban from coming into effect, finding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their argument that the proclamation violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and exceeded the president's powers under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). This injunction was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that the proclamation was likely a violation of INA; the court of appeals did not reach the constitutional issue.  
On June 26, 2018, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals in a 5–4 decision, ruling that plaintiffs did not have  "likelihood of success on the merits" on either their INA or their Establishment Clause claims. The court vacated the injunction and remanded the case to lower courts for further proceedings. The decision of the Court, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, applied rational basis review and emphasized deference to the executive branch. In addressing the travel ban, the Court also repudiated the infamous decision of Korematsu v. United States, , which had justified the President's powers to establish internment camps for Japanese Americans during World War II.  
In dissent, Justice Sotomayor wrote that the majority's decision "redeploys the same dangerous logic underlying Korematsu and merely replaces one gravely wrong decision with another." Responding to this dissent, Roberts wrote for the majority that "Korematsu has nothing to do with this case. The forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential authority." It is not agreed upon among legal scholars as to whether this statement actually overturned Korematsu or was merely a "disapproving dictum" of it. 
 Background 
 Executive Orders 13769 and 13780 
As part of his immigration policy, United States President Donald Trump had sought to limit foreigners from certain countries from traveling into the United States. Initially he signed Executive Order 13769 (EO 13769) on January 27, 2017, which among its provisions banned entry to citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for a 90-day period regardless of their visa status, and suspended the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days. Because the countries affected have large Muslim populations and Trump repeatedly called for banning Muslim immigration during his Presidential campaign, EO 13769 was commonly referred to as the "Muslim ban", and was heavily criticized by many state legislatures and federal lawmakers. Several lawsuits were filed to challenge the order, and in Washington v. Trump, heard in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a restraining order was placed on enforcement of EO 13769 on February 3, 2017.
President Trump then signed Executive Order 13780 (EO 13780) on March 6, 2017, replacing EO 13769 to acknowledge the findings from the Ninth Circuit. It did not outright ban travel from citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, but required significant additional scrutiny before they would be able to enter the United States and banned new visas for these countries for 90 days. It also continued to suspend USRAP for 120 days.
 Hawaii's challenge to EO 13780 
As with EO 13769, EO 13780 was immediately criticized and was legally challenged in several cases. Of note was a challenge from the State of Hawaii, which formed the basis of the Supreme Court case. Hawaii brought a civil action challenging the executive order on March 7, asking for declaratory judgment and an injunction halting the order. The State of Hawaii moved for leave to file an Amended Complaint pertaining to Executive Order 13780. Doug Chin, Hawaii's Attorney General, publicly stated, "This new executive order is nothing more than Muslim Ban 2.0. Under the pretense of national security, it still targets immigrants and refugees. It leaves the door open for even further restrictions." Hawaii's legal challenge to the revised ban cites top White House advisor Stephen Miller as saying the revised travel ban is meant to achieve the same basic policy outcome as the original.
The Amended Complaint lists eight specific causes of action pertaining to Executive Order 13780:
 Violation of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause claiming the travel ban targets Muslims
 Violation of the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection clause
 Violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (substantive due process)
 Violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (procedural due process)
 Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (a)(1)(A) and (f) and (a)
 Violations of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act -1(a)
 Substantive violation of the Administrative Procedure Act through violations of the Constitution, Immigration and Nationality Act, and arbitrary and capricious action (2)(A)–(C).
 Procedural violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (2)(D), (1), and 
On March 15, 2017, Judge Derrick Watson of the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii issued a temporary restraining order preventing sections 2 and 6 of executive order 13780 from going into effect. In his order, Judge Watson ruled that the State of Hawaii showed a strong likelihood of success on their Establishment Clause claim in asserting that Executive Order 13780 was in fact a "Muslim ban". Judge Watson stated in his ruling, "When considered alongside the constitutional injuries and harms discussed above, and the questionable evidence supporting the Government's national security motivations, the balance of equities and public interests justify granting the Plaintiffs. Nationwide relief is appropriate in light of the likelihood of success on the Establishment Clause claim." He also stated, concerning the Order's neutrality to religion, that the government's position that Courts may not look behind the exercise of executive discretion and must only review the text of the Order was rejected as being legally incorrect, and that:
In drawing its conclusion, the Court further quoted the Ninth Circuit appeal ruling on the original Executive Order (13769): "It is well established that evidence of purpose beyond the face of the challenged law may be considered in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause claims", and quoted in support of its findings, previous rulings that "Official action that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment cannot be shielded by mere compliance with the requirement of facial neutrality" (Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah); "a facially neutral statute violated the Establishment Clause in light of legislative history demonstrating an intent to apply regulations only to minority religions" (Larson v. Valente); and that "circumstantial evidence of intent, including the historical background of the decision and statements by decisionmakers, may be considered in evaluating whether a governmental action was motivated by a discriminatory purpose" (Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing); ending with a comment that "the Supreme Court has been even more emphatic: courts may not 'turn a blind eye to the context in which [a] policy arose (McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, ruled that a law becomes unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause if its "ostensible or predominant purpose" is to favor or disfavor any religion over any otherhttp://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/03-1693/opinion.html, pp. 10–11.). The Court also took into account numerous statements by the President and his team prior to and since election, which had directly stated that he sought a legal means to achieve a total ban on Muslims entering the United States, and a "dearth" of substantive evidence in support of the stated security benefits.
After Judge Watson's ruling a Department of Justice spokeswoman said the administration would continue to defend the executive order in the courts. President Trump denounced the ruling as "an unprecedented judicial overreach", and indicated that the decision would be appealed, if necessary to the Supreme Court, stating that, "We're talking about the safety of our nation, the safety and security of our people. This ruling makes us look weak."
There were 5 opinions attached to the order denying en banc. Stephen Reinhardt and Marsha Berzon each wrote concurring opinions, while Alex Kozinski, Carlos Bea, and Jay Bybee each filed a dissenting opinion. Judge Kozinski of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals filed a late dissent on March 17, 2017, to the Ninth Circuit's opinion in Washington v. Trump arguing against the State of Washington's Establishment Clause claims on grounds that Trump's speech during the campaign was political speech protected by the First Amendment. Even though the Ninth Circuit had declined to address that issue in reaching its ruling on Washington v. Trump and U.S. courts do not typically rule on issues that are not before them, Kozinski argued it was appropriate for him to address the issue because Judge Watson in Hawaii had cited the Ninth Circuit opinion in reaching its Establishment Clause ruling.
On March 29, 2017, Judge Watson extended his order blocking the ban for a longer duration. The DOJ appealed this ruling. On May 15, a panel of the Ninth Circuit heard arguments on whether to uphold the nationwide injunction. Acting Solicitor General of the United States Jeffrey Wall and Hawaii's attorney, Neal Katyal, appeared before Circuit Judges Ronald M. Gould, Michael Daly Hawkins, and Richard Paez for an hour of oral arguments in Seattle's William Kenzo Nakamura United States Courthouse.
On June 12, 2017, a unanimous panel of the Ninth Circuit partially upheld Judge Watson's injunction. In its anonymous per curiam decision, the court found President Trump's order violated the relevant statute, and so must be enjoined. However, the court found Judge Watson should have avoided the constitutional question, and that he should not have enjoined the purely internal government vetting review.
On June 19, 2017, Judge Watson complied with the decision of the Ninth Circuit and curtailed the injunction such that the injunction would exempt "internal review procedures that do not burden individuals outside of the executive branch of the federal government".
On June 26, 2017, in an unsigned per curiam decision, the United States Supreme Court stayed the lower court injunctions as applied to those who have no "credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States". The Court also granted certiorari and set oral arguments for the fall term. The Court did not clarify what constitutes a bona fide relationship. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch, partially dissented, writing that the lower courts' entire injunctions against the executive order should be stayed.
On June 29, President Trump sent out a diplomatic cable to embassies and consulates seeking to define what qualifies as a "bona fide relationship", excluding connections with refugee resettlement agencies, and clarifying that step-siblings and half-siblings are close family while grandparents and nephews are not.
On July 14 in Honolulu, Judge Watson found that the President's limitations on refugee resettlement agencies and family definitions violated the Supreme Court's order, writing "grandparents are the epitome of close family members". On July 19, the Supreme Court left in place Judge Watson's order on family definitions, but it stayed while on appeal the part of his injunction on refugee resettlement agencies. Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch said they would have stayed Judge Watson's entire order. The Court also scheduled oral arguments in the case for October 10. After Judge Watson's order allowing refugee resettlements was then affirmed on appeal, the Supreme Court, on September 12, 2017, issued a stay blocking the order indefinitely.
 Presidential Proclamation 9645 
On September 24, 2017, Trump signed the new Presidential Proclamation replacing and expanding the March Executive Order. The Supreme Court canceled its hearing, and Solicitor General Noel Francisco then asked the Court to declare the case moot and also vacate the lower courts' judgments. On October 10, 2017, the Supreme Court did so with regard to the Fourth Circuit case. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, saying the Court should not vacate the judgment below but only dismiss their review as improvidently granted. The Court took no action on the Ninth Circuit case, which addressed the President's refugee ban that expired on October 24.
The Supreme Court allowed the travel ban to go into full effect on December 4, pending legal challenges. Seven of the nine justices lifted the injunctions imposed by the lower courts, while two justices wanted the order to be blocked.
On December 22, 2017, a three-judge panel of United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ruled that President Trump's Executive Order "exceeds the scope of his delegated authority", to deem classes of people by their national origin ineligible to enter the country under the Immigration and Nationality Act. In response, the Trump administration petitioned the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari to challenge the Ninth Circuit's findings, which the Court granted on January 22, 2018.
 Supreme Court 
The Court heard oral arguments in Trump v. Hawaii (Docket 17-965) for an hour on April 25, 2018, during which Noel Francisco, the Solicitor General of the United States, personally appeared for the federal government and Neal Katyal appeared for the state.<ref   It was the first time that the Supreme Court had a hearing on any version of the travel ban. Observers of the session believed that the five conservative judges sided with the government in enforcing the ban, though the Court as a whole asked whether the ban equated to religious discrimination and whether it were within presidential power to impose such a ban.
Prior to issuing its ruling in Trump v. Hawaii, the Court ruled on Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission (Docket 16-111), a case involving the intersection of anti-discrimination laws and the free exercise of religion. Amongst considerations informing the decision of the Court was a finding that the defendant's ruling was based on statements made by public officials which evinced "clear and impermissible hostility" and were not religiously neutral towards the petitioner; the Court reversed the officials' ruling on this basis. Justice Anthony Kennedy had referenced his majority opinion of Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah  which similarly dealt with the neutrality of language that legislators used to justify an otherwise neutrally-worded law, which the Court deemed impermissible and therefore declared the law unconstitutional. Some analysts believed that this part of the majority opinion would affect Trump v. Hawaii; analysts noted "clear and impermissible hostility" in language used to support the ban by public officials, including President Trump.
Opinion of the Court
The Court delivered its opinion on June 26, 2018, ruling in a 5–4 decision split along ideological lines that upheld the validity of the travel ban as within the President's powers. Justices Breyer and Sotomayor both read aloud versions of their dissents from the bench. The decision lifted the current injunction against the travel ban's enforcement and remanded the case to lower courts for review of other arguments raised by the plaintiffs.
Delivering the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts concluded that the language of 8 U. S. C. §1182(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act was clear in giving the President broad authority to suspend the entry of non-citizens into the country and that Trump's Presidential Proclamation 9645 did not exceed any textual limit on the President's authority.  Under 8 U. S. C. §1182(f), a President may limit alien entry when he finds that such entry "would be detrimental to the interests of the United States." Trump determined that alien entries from some countries would be detrimental because those countries do not share adequate information with the U.S. for an informed decision on entry, and that entries from other countries are detrimental because their citizens create national security risks. Trump showed that the limits he put in place were tailored to protect American interests. The only prerequisite set forth in §1182(f) is that the President "find" that the entry of the covered aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the U.S. The Supreme Court rule: "The President has undoubtedly fulfilled that requirement here." According to Roberts, Trump acted within his powers.
Roberts pointed out that even though five of the seven nations have a Muslim majority, that fact alone "does not support an inference of religious hostility, given that the policy covers just 8% of the world's Muslim population and is limited to countries that were previously designated by Congress or prior administrations as posing national security risks." Additionally, three Muslim-majority countries have since been dropped from the original Travel Ban upon Trump's inauguration. Similarly, there are waiver exemptions such as medical that people from banned nations are eligible for. In conclusion, Roberts says the White House had shown a "sufficient national security justification". The plaintiffs had standing because they had been separated from their families.
The main issue was whether the travel ban violated the Establishment Clause to the US Constitution which prohibits the government from making any law "respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Plaintiffs argued that it did due to the President's statements regarding Islam, which may have cast doubt as to the federal objective being free from specifically targeting religion, and if religion is targeted intentionally, then strict scrutiny review applies which requires the government to show that the act was necessary to meet a compelling governmental interest. The court held that the President's travel ban did not violate the Free Exercise Clause where the statements he makes are reasonably understood to result from justification independent of unconstitutional grounds. That independent justification here was national security.  Thus, the court applied rational basis review and upheld the travel ban.
Korematsu
Part of the majority's decision referenced Korematsu v. United States, , which upheld the constitutionality of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order, which forced Japanese-American citizens into concentration camps during World War II. The dissenting opinions in Trump had raised the case among their arguments, leading Roberts to write for the majority that "[t]he dissent's reference to Korematsu, however, affords this Court the opportunity to make express what is already obvious: Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and – to be clear – 'has no place in law under the Constitution (citing Justice Robert H. Jackson's dissent from Korematsu). Scholars disagree on whether this statement "constitutes an actual overturning of Korematsu or merely disapproving dictum" of the decision.
Concurring opinions
Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Clarence Thomas filed concurring opinions. Kennedy concurred with the majority in finding that the President does have the authority to issue the ban, but emphasized the need for the lower courts to review the ban to make sure it itself is constitutional. In addition, Justice Kennedy went on to discuss the need for United States officials to keep the Constitution in mind when speaking, even if their statements are not able to be adjudicated using judicial review. Justice Thomas's concurrence questioned the need and immediacy of a nationwide injunction against the EO, and the ability of a District Court to issue such an injunction, supporting the decision to reverse the District Court's order.
Dissenting opinions
Justice Stephen Breyer wrote one dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Elena Kagan, where he agreed with the majority that the case should be remanded to the lower court for further review, but believed the injunction on the ban should remain. He took issue with the standards of how waivers and exemptions to the EO were being made, noting that previous Executive Orders on immigration have used consistent standards for waivers, such as Executive Order 12172 under President Jimmy Carter banning immigrants from Iran. If the current EO ban was following its waiver system, that would strengthen the government's position that the ban was religiously neutral. However, he documented several cases where the waiver process under the EO had seemingly been inconsistent, weakening the government's position. Justice Breyer concluded that Declarations, anecdotal evidence, facts, and numbers taken from amicus briefs are not judicial fact findings. The Government has not had an opportunity to respond, and a court has not had an opportunity to decide. But, given the importance of the decision in this case, the need for assurance that the Proclamation does not rest upon a 'Muslim ban', and the assistance in deciding the issue that answers to the 'exemption and waiver' questions may provide, I would send this case back to the District Court for further proceedings. And, I would leave the injunction in effect while the matter is litigated.
If this Court must decide the question without this further litigation, I would, on balance, find the evidence of antireligious bias...a sufficient reason to set the Proclamation aside.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a more scathing dissent, fully critical of the majority's opinion: The United States of America is a Nation built upon the promise of religious liberty. Our Founders honored that core promise by embedding the principle of religious neutrality in the First Amendment. The Court's decision today fails to safeguard that fundamental principle. It leaves undisturbed a policy first advertised openly and unequivocally as a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" because the policy now masquerades behind a façade of national-security concerns.
Justice Sotomayor took issue with a perceived double standard that the Court held with the decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, , which found that government officials had treated a defendant's freedom of religious exercise with hostility, demanding the case be reheard on a more neutral basis. She wrote that "Unlike in Masterpiece, where the majority considered the state commissioners' statements about religion to be persuasive evidence of unconstitutional government action, the majority here completely sets aside the President's charged statements about Muslims as irrelevant".
Sotomayor further noted the parallels between this case and Korematsu, acknowledging the legacy of that decision and the cautions that the dissenting judges there had made towards the threat to the Constitution as a result. Although she welcomed that the majority opinion had effectively jettisoned Korematsu, she feared the decision of Trump "redeploys the same dangerous logic underlying Korematsu and merely replaces one 'gravely wrong' decision with another."
Reactions
After the Supreme Court decision, various protests were held around the United States, including one in front of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C. Additional protests were held in New York City, Seattle, Portland, and Atlanta.

From "Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP" ==> """
Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP, 591 U.S. ___ (2020) was a landmark US Supreme Court case involving subpoenas issued by committees of the US House of Representatives to obtain the tax returns of President Donald Trump, who had litigated against his personal accounting firm to prevent this disclosure, although the committees had been cleared by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Mazars was consolidated with Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG (591 U.S. ___, docket 19-760). 
In a 7–2 decision issued on July 9, 2020, the Supreme Court held that courts must take into account separation of powers in resolving disputes over congressional subpoenas seeking the personal information of the president, and set out a number of factors to consider in evaluating the worthiness of such subpoena requests. The Supreme Court ruled that the lower court had not properly considered the separation of powers concerns; it vacated the lower court's decision and remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for review. The Supreme Court decided that the case raised questions of separation of powers, rather than executive privilege. It also noted that to request presidential documents like tax returns, Congress needs a legislative reason and may not conduct a criminal investigation, which is a power of the executive branch.Trump Not 'Immune' From Releasing Tax Returns, Supreme Court Rules Before the lower court reviewed the case, the subpoenas in question expired with the end of the 116th Congress on January 3, 2021, and on February 23, 2021, the House Committee in the 117th Congress reissued the subpoena to Mazars for the same documents it had previously sought.
Legal scholar Marty Lederman described Mazars as more important than Trump v. Vance, which was decided the same day. Lederman described Trump's argument that Congress entirely lacks "constitutional authority to investigate a sitting President's possible conflicts of interest and violations of law" as an "alarming" assertion that "would, if credited, be a radical departure from our constitutional history and tradition."
Background
In April 2019, three committees of the US House of Representatives wanted to access the financial records of US President Donald Trump, his children, and affiliated businesses. They regarded attempts at subpoenaing Trump directly as likely to be futile and so issued four subpoenas to third parties. The House Committee on Financial Services subpoenaed Deutsche Bank and Capital One to seek records related to foreign transactions, business statements, debt schedules, statements of net worth, tax returns, and suspicious activity identified by the banks.
The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence also subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for the same information. The House Committee on Oversight and Reform issued a subpoena to Trump's personal accounting firm, Mazars USA, LLP, demanding financial information pertaining to Trump and several affiliated businesses. Although each of the committees sought overlapping sets of financial documents, all of them supplied different justifications for the requests and explained that the information would help guide legislative reform in areas ranging from money laundering and terrorism to foreign involvement in US elections.
 Lower courts 
 Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP 
Mazars was willing to comply with the subpoena, but Trump, in his personal capacity, sued Mazars to stop the firm from providing the information sought. The subpoena was stayed while the case wound its way through the courts. Trump lost both in the district court and on appeal, and Trump appealed to the Supreme Court.
In the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, on July 12, 2019, Trump said he was suing to prevent Mazars from complying with the subpoena and argued that the Committee's investigation into his financial records served no legitimate legislative purpose. On October 11, 2019, Judge David S. Tatel wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Judge Patricia Millett, dismissing Trump's arguments. Judge Neomi Rao dissented, saying that the impeachment power is the only legitimate method for such congressional investigations.
On November 13, 2019, the DC Court of Appeals denied the Trump's petition for an en banc rehearing 7-3; Gregory Katsas, Neomi Rao, and Karen Henderson dissenting.
On Trump's appeal, on November 18, 2019, the Supreme Court agreed to continue the stay for a few days and ordered the House Counsel to submit a rebuttal by November 21, which was done. House General Counsel Douglas Letter, in seeking a rapid subpoena ruling, wrote: "The president certainly has no right to dictate the timetable by which third parties provide information that could potentially be relevant to that inquiry."
 Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG 
The case has had multiple stages of movement through lower courts before being presented for arguments to the US Supreme Court:
Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG, 943 F. 3d 627 - Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit 2019
Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG, 940 F. 3d 146 - Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit 2019
Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG, 140 S. Ct. 660 - Supreme Court 2019
The case was argued in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York before Judge Edgardo Ramos on May 22, 2019, who ruled against Trump and ordered the banks to comply with the subpoenas. Trump appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. While the appeal was pending, Capital One submitted a letter to the court that it did not have any documents falling under the purview of the subpoena, but Deutsche Bank filed a letter stating otherwise. The court heard oral arguments on August 23, 2019.
The Deutsche Bank letter had two names redacted; an unredacted copy of the letter was also submitted under seal. In September, a motion was jointly filed by CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Associated Press, and Politico to unseal the names. A week later, Reuters and Dow Jones & Company filed a motion to the same effect. In a 12-page unanimous opinion by Senior Judge Jon O. Newman, the judges denied the requests to unseal and stated that the mere filing of a sealed document is not sufficient grounds for it to enter public access. They also said that they would have been more compelled to unseal the names if Trump had been one of the redacted names, but they said that neither of them was.
On December 3, 2019, Judge Newman wrote the majority opinion, with Judge Peter W. Hall joining and Judge Debra Ann Livingston dissenting in part. Judge Newman's ruling mostly affirmed the district court's ruling ordering the banks to give documents to the US House of Representatives committees, but it partially remanded the case back to the District Court to allow Trump to argue against disclosing other specific personal information. In her partial dissent, Judge Livingston expressed concern that the subpoenas were too broad, calling them "deeply troubling" and would have fully remanded the case to the District Court to address that concern.
After the ruling, Trump appealed the case as well as Trump v. Mazars to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari in both cases.
Supreme Court
On November 25, 2019, the US Supreme Court granted a stay of the DC Circuit ruling extending the time for Trump to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to ask the Supreme Court to hear the case.19A545 TRUMP, DONALD J., ET AL. V. MAZARS USA, LLP, ET AL. supremecourt.gov November 25, 2019 Trump's legal team filed the petition on December 5, and on December 13, the Court granted certiorari and consolidated Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG with the Mazars case. The Court also granted certiorari for Trump v. Vance, a similar challenge related to subpoenas for Trump's tax records but from the Manhattan district attorney's office in relation to its ongoing investigation over payments made as part of the Stormy Daniels scandal. 
The question facing the Court was whether the US House of Representatives has the authority to issue subpoenas addressed to third parties to obtain the private financial records of the president and his businesses.
Oral arguments were originally scheduled to take place on March 31, 2020, but two weeks before the arguments were to take place, the Supreme Court postponed arguments in response to the coronavirus pandemic and waited one month to announce the rescheduled date. In April 2020, the Supreme Court said that oral argument in Mazars and other cases would be heard by telephone. The oral arguments for the consolidated Trump v. Mazars and Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG, as well as Trump v. Vance, were heard on May 12. In arguing against the need for subpoenas for tax returns, Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall repeatedly cited that they presented "dangers of harassing and distracting and undermining the President."
 Decision 
The Supreme Court issued its ruling on July 9, 2020. In the 7–2 decision, the Court vacated the decision of the DC Circuit, which granted the subpoena, and that of the Second Circuit. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the lower courts for further assessment of separation of powers between the president and Congress.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by all but Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. In the decision, Roberts wrote that the Circuit Court had not taken full account of the separation of powers in its decision and stated that neither the congressional argument nor the presidential argument was wholly sound. Roberts wrote, "The standards proposed by the president and the solicitor general — if applied outside the context of privileged information — would risk seriously impeding Congress in carrying out its responsibilities.... The House's approach fails to take adequate account of the significant separation of powers issues raised by congressional subpoenas for the president's information. Far from accounting for separation of powers concerns, the House's approach aggravates them by leaving essentially no limits on the congressional power to subpoena the president's personal records. Any personal paper possessed by a president could potentially 'relate to' a conceivable subject of legislation, for Congress has broad legislative powers that touch a vast number of subjects." He also noted that other conflicts between the legislative and the executive branches on subpoenas had been resolved by both political branches of the federal government by negotiation and compromise without involvement by the Supreme Court. Roberts recognized that the executive privilege is designed to safeguard presidential decision-making, but he noted that the president does not have blanket immunity from records requests since the protection caused by executive privilege "should not be transplanted root and branch to cases involving nonprivileged, private information, which by definition does not implicate sensitive Executive Branch deliberations."
Roberts stated that congressional subpoenas directed at the president and his personal papers demand careful scrutiny "for they stem from a rival political branch that has an ongoing relationship with the president and incentives to use subpoenas for institutional advantage." In sending the case back to a lower court, Roberts gave the court four considerations to determine whether the subpoenas were appropriate:
 Whether the legislative request warrants the involvement of the president and if other sources can reasonably provide Congress the same information
 Whether the subpoena is no broader than is reasonably necessary to support the legislative objective
 Whether the nature of evidence that is requested by the subpoena would advance a valid legislative purpose
 Whether the subpoena burdens the president and may be a result from partisan politics.
Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito both wrote dissenting opinions asserting that the subpoenas were invalid. Thomas claimed that since the documents sought do not pertain to the presidency, the subpoenas must have been made as part of an impeachment investigation. Alito agreed that the case should be remanded but argued that the House committees had not shown adequate justification and that the majority opinion's criteria were an insufficient remedy for the lower courts.
Impact and aftermath
The Supreme Court's decision in Mazars was generally considered favorable to Trump from a political standpoint even though the rulings in both Mazars and the associated Vance case could allow the tax returns to be subpoenaed. The ruling acknowledged that Congress has the power to subpoena the president and his papers as part of the legislative process, but it set limits to these requests. While the challenges to the House subpoenas were returned to the Circuit Court for review based on the four considerations set out by Roberts, they were not resolved before the November 2020 presidential election. Trump's political opponents had hoped to use the tax returns as part of their strategy in the campaign.
 Reissued subpoena 
Before the District Court reviewed the case, the subpoenas in question expired with the end of the 116th Congress on January 3, 2021. After Trump left office, on February 23, 2021, the House Oversight and Reform Committee in the 117th Congress reissued the subpoena to Mazars for the same documents it had previously sought. The reissued subpoena followed the rejection by the Supreme Court on February 22 of Trump's last-ditch bid to keep his records away from Manhattan District Attorney Vance in Trump v. Vance and their prompt production by Mazars. The joint status report of the parties filed on March 2 suggested a schedule for additional arguments and briefings stretching into June.House Oversight Committee reissues subpoena for Trump financial records Carolyn Maloney, Chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee, said that the new subpoena will again be "for financial records related to the committee's investigations into presidential conflicts of interest, presidential contracts with the federal government and self-dealing, and presidential emoluments."House Oversight panel reissues subpoena for Trump's financial records
 District Court review 
The case was reviewed by the District Court on August 11, 2021. Applying the criteria now set out in Mazars''' case, the court held that the Committee's asserted legislative purpose of bolstering financial disclosure laws for Presidents and presidential candidates does not warrant disclosure of President Trump's personal and corporate financial records. However, the Committee's other stated justifications for demanding President Trump's personal and corporate financial records—to legislate on the topic of federal lease agreements and conduct oversight of the General Services Administration's lease with the Trump Old Post Office, LLC (which had been leased for 60 years to a Trump company in 2013), and to legislate pursuant to Congress's authority under the Foreign Emoluments Clause—do not raise the same separation of powers concerns. The court ruled that records relating to those justifications must be disclosed.

From "Trump v. New York" ==> """
Trump v. New York, 592 U.S. ___ (2020), was a United States Supreme Court case dealing with the 2020 United States Census. It centered on the validity of a July 2020 executive memorandum from President Donald Trump to the Department of Commerce, which conducts and reports the Census. The memo ordered the Department to exclude the estimated counts of illegal immigrants from the results of the Census. The memo was challenged by a coalition of U.S. states led by New York along with several cities and other organizations suing to block action on the memo. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York found for the states and blocked enforcement of the memo, leading Trump to seek emergency relief asking the Supreme Court to rule on the matter before the results of the Census were due on December 31, 2020. The Court issued a per curiam decision on December 18, 2020, vacating the District Court's ruling and dismissing the case because lack of standing and ripeness made the case premature. The same decision was reached by the court on December 18, 2020, for the similar "Trump v. Useche" case. 
While multiple states vowed to bring the case back to the Supreme Court immediately after the required Census results were reported, thereby establishing standing and ripeness, the Trump Administration struggled immensely with implementation (due in part to the Supreme Court case Department of Commerce v. New York). Ultimately, Trump's successor after the 2020 election, Joe Biden, issued Executive Order 13986 which required non-citizens to be counted in the 2020 Census, both for the purposes of enumeration and determining congressional apportionment, thereby reversing the order issued by the Trump administration and ending the controversy.
Background
Article One, section 2, clause 3 of the United States Constitution directs the population be enumerated at least once every ten years and the resulting counts used to set the number of members from each state in the House of Representatives and, by extension, in the Electoral College.
During the debates surrounding the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, "many members of Congress urged that only citizens or voters should be counted in determining congressional representation, insisting that foreigners who had arrived in America should not count for purposes of apportioning representatives to Congress." After seven months of debate, this language was not adopted.
The 2020 Census is considered to have become a highly politicized event under President Trump. Trump ran on a platform to reduce the number of illegal immigrants in the United States. As preparations for the Census approached, the Department of Commerce, which manages the United States Census Bureau, announced its intention to reintroduce a question on the Census asking about one's immigration status within the Census' "short form" which would be sent to all households. The Department's intentions of this question were unclear, and many states, cities, and advocacy groups feared the question would lead some immigrants, including those with legal status in the country, to not answer the Census, undercounting populations and affecting government representation and federal funding over the next decade. These states and other groups sued, and in the Supreme Court case Department of Commerce v. New York, the Court ruled in June 2019 that the rationale provided by the Commerce Department was arbitrary and capricious, and forbid the Department from including the question unless they could provide a better explanation. The Department opted not to include the question on the final forms that went out.
Following the Supreme Court's decision, Trump stated he still planned to use other means to estimate the number of undocumented immigrants as part of the Census report. On July 21, 2020, he signed a memo to the Department of Commerce, "Memorandum On Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census". The order instructed the Department to exclude the estimated number of undocumented immigrants (those not covered by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965) from the totals when they submit their report documenting the Census results by December 31, 2020. The administration argued that the apportionment clause of Article One of the Constitution does not define which "which persons must be included in the apportionment base" for the Census count.Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census Since the Census has normally excluded immigrants that have only temporarily been in the country such as diplomats, the administration argued this gave Trump the freedom to exclude these undocumented immigrants.
At least three separate legal challenges against the memo were filed within the week of the memo's signing. One case was filed by Common Cause in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Two others were filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York; one by a coalition of 22 states, the District of Columbia, 15 cities, and the United States Conference of Mayors, and another filed the American Civil Liberties Union and New York Civil Liberties Union. All three suits generally argued that the interpretation of "persons" from the Constitution as argued by the administration was gravely flawed given past case history and how the census has historically been conducted, and that the memo represented another arbitrary and capricious rulemaking decision. Analysis by the Pew Research Center based on population trends estimated that at least four states, California, Texas, Florida, and Arizona, could lose a Representative should illegal immigrants be discounted in the Census total, while Montana would be set to gain a seat.
The two cases in the Southern District of New York were combined, and its ruling was issued on September 10, 2020, blocking enforcement of the memo. The three-judge panel ruled that while the President has some discretion of how the Census results are reported, the authority to deviate from the Constitution statute, requiring "a statement showing the whole number of persons in each State", can only be set forth by Congress, and thus the memo exceeds the authority that the President has been given by Congress, ruling it invalid.
Supreme Court
Trump petitioned the Supreme Court for an expedited hearing given the nearness of the December 31 deadline following the District Court's ruling. The petition asks to challenge the standing of the states and cities to be able to take legal action against the memo, as well as to affirm the administration's interpretation of "persons" in the apportionment clause. The Supreme Court certified the petition on October 16, 2020, and with oral hearings held on November 30, 2020. Observers to the hearing said that the Court, including its conservative members, appeared to doubt the claims that the President could alter who was counted via the Census, but as there was yet no Census data to review, the Justices also appeared uncertain how to proceed. The court observers believed that the Justices were likely not to act quickly to stop the order and may wait for the results to be collected and how that could impact federal representation to judge how to handle the case.
The Court issued a per curiam decision on December 18, 2020, which vacated the District Court's ruling and remanded the case to that court with orders to dismiss it. The opinion stated that there were issues with both standing and ripeness to the case that made it premature. The Court stated they did not consider the constitutional merits of the case: "Consistent with our determination that standing has not been shown and that the case is not ripe, we express no view on the merits of the constitutional and related statutory claims presented. We hold only that they are not suitable for adjudication at this time."
Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissent, which was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Breyer's dissent stated that the Court should have considered the case to evaluate the Executive Order since it was aimed to discount people from the Census count.

From "Trump v. Vance" ==> """
Trump v. Vance, 591 U.S. ___ (2020), was a landmark US Supreme Court case arising from a subpoena issued in August 2019 by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. against Mazars, then-President Donald Trump's accounting firm, for Trump's tax records and related documents, as part of his ongoing investigation into the Stormy Daniels scandal. Trump commenced legal proceedings to prevent their release. 
The Court held that Article II and the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution do not categorically preclude or require a heightened standard for the issuance of a state criminal subpoena to a sitting president. The 7–2 decision was issued in July 2020, with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissenting.
Background
After Donald Trump indicated his intent to run for US president as a Republican candidate, he was called upon to release his income tax returns in the public interest, as most other presidential candidates did. Trump had stated in his campaign that he would release them once they had been "worked on."  After his election victory and taking office in 2017, Trump refused to give over his tax records and stated that voters were not interested in them.
The Democratic Party gained control of the US House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections, and by April 2019, the House Ways and Means Committee had formally requested from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) six years of Trump's returns, a power vested in Congress under . The IRS failed to comply with the request. Both the Ways and Means Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Reform filed subpoenas to Mazars, Trump's accounting firm, to obtain the tax information. The Trump administration refused to comply with the subpoenas and asserted that they lacked "a legitimate legislative purpose." However, those subpoenas were directed at Mazars and later at Deutsche Bank and Capital One, where Trump had accounts, and those entities had indicated they would comply with the subpoenas. Trump then tried to block the subpoenas, which led to two separate suits, Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP and Trump et al. v. Deutsche Bank AG, which were consolidated under the Trump v. Mazars suit by the Supreme Court in its 2019 term.
District Court 
Separately, as part of the city's ongoing criminal investigation into the Stormy Daniels scandal, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. in August 2019 subpoenaed Mazars for Trump's tax returns. Trump filed suit against the district attorney and Mazars in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York to block the subpoena arguing that a sitting president enjoys "absolute immunity from criminal process of any kind."
Prosecutors countered that Trump had "sweeping immunity" from a criminal probe while he was in office and that Trump was "seeking to invent and enforce a new presidential 'tax return privilege,' on the theory that disclosing information in a tax return will necessarily reveal information that will somehow impede the functioning of a President, sufficiently to meet the test of irreparable harm."
The District Court dismissed the case on the basis of Younger v. Harris (1971), which had stated federal courts should abstain in the matters of tort claims being brought by the person who was prosecuted by those claims. As such, the District Court ordered Trump to comply with the subpoena, pending a ruling from the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
 Second Circuit 
The Second Circuit panel ruled unanimously against Trump in November 2019. The decision stated that the president is not immune from "the enforcement of a state grand jury subpoena directing a third party to produce non-privileged material, even when the subject matter under investigation pertains to the President" and that a state grand jury may issue subpoenas "in aid of its investigation of potential crimes committed by persons within its jurisdiction, even if that investigation may in some way implicate the President."Benjamin Weiser & Adam Liptak, Trump Taxes: Appeals Court Rules President Must Turn Over 8 Years of Tax Returns , New York Times (November 4, 2019).Trump v. Vance (2d Cir. Nov. 4, 2019).
Supreme Court
Trump petitioned to the US Supreme Court on the Second Circuit's ruling to the New York district attorney subpoena as well as in the separate cases related to the House Committee subpoenas. The Supreme Court certified all three cases in December 2019 by consolidating the two House Committee cases into Trump v. Mazars and handling the New York case under Trump v. Vance separately.
Oral arguments were held on May 12, 2020, alongside the Trump v. Mazars arguments, both as part of the set of cases held through teleconference because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Observers recognized that the Justices treated Vance, which involved a subpoena related to a grand jury criminal investigation, and Mazars, involving subpoenas related to a Congressional investigation, very differently and expected there to be different results between the cases, with Vance likely to favor the release of the tax records. Justices also spoke of possibly sending both cases to the lower courts with a set of standards to evaluate the subpoena requests.
Majority opinion
The Court released its decision on July 9, 2020, by affirming the decision of the Second Circuit and remanding the case for continued review. The 7–2 decision affirmed that absolute immunity to the president is not granted by the Supremacy Clause or Article II of the Constitution. Through those principles, the Court also held that the president enjoys no absolute immunity from state criminal subpoenas directed at his private papers and that he is not entitled to a heightened standard for the issuance of such a subpoena. Instead, Trump can rely on the defenses that are available to everyone else like overbreadth and unwarranted harassment. In remanding the case to the District Court, the Court's order stated that "the President may raise further arguments as appropriate" to challenge the subpoena. In evaluating those arguments judges should be "meticulous" according to the Court, but "this does not mean they should use a stricter standard in evaluating them."
The majority opinion was written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Roberts wrote that former Chief Justice John Marshall established the principle 200 years earlier that no citizen, including the president, may escape the common duty to produce evidence when he is called upon during a criminal proceeding.  Roberts wrote, "In our judicial system, 'the public has a right to every man's evidence'. Since the earliest days of the Republic, 'every man' has included the President of the United States." 
Concurring opinion
Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a concurring opinion joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch. Kavanaugh wrote that he would have held the case to the standard established in United States v. Nixon, which determined that a prosecutor must have a "demonstrated, specific need" for subpoenaing a President. Otherwise, Kavanaugh agreed with the judgement and added that the Court "unanimously agrees that this case should be remanded to the District Court, where the President may raise constitutional and legal objections to the subpoena as appropriate."
Dissenting opinions
Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito wrote separate dissenting opinions. 
Thomas wrote that the majority opinion, which allowed subpoenas to be placed against the president, created an undue burden: "the demands on the president's time and the importance of his tasks are extraordinary, and the office of the president cannot be delegated to subordinates. A subpoena imposes both demands on the president's limited time and a mental burden, even when the president is not directly engaged in complying."
Alito wrote on his concern that the majority opinion would open the president to potential action from over 2000 local prosecutors and would impair the functionality of the presidential office: "Respect for the structure of government created by the Constitution demands greater protection for an institution that is vital to the nation's safety and well-being."
Post-judgement
On the same day, the Trump v. Mazars case was remanded to the lower court by the Supreme Court with the same 7–2 split. Congress has the authority to subpoena the president as part of its legislative duties, but the Supreme Court found a stronger requirement to exist for the congressional subpoena than for a state grand jury subpoena. Chief Justice Roberts gave the lower courts a list of four considerations to determine when a congressional subpoena is appropriate within the scope of the separation of powers. 
At the request of Vance, the Supreme Court on July 17, 2020 allowed the judgment from its ruling to take effect immediately, instead of the 25 days after decision normally established, to allow the district attorney's office to proceed to request documents while the judicial arguments continued.
Remand to District Court
On the remand of Trump v. Vance to the Southern New York District Court, Judge Victor Marrero set a deadline of July 15, 2020, for Trump to provide additional objections to the subpoena. Trump’s revised complaint asserted that Vance's subpoena was politically motivated and overly broad. Marrero declined to block the subpoena on August 20, 2020, saying that Trump's new complaint was not substantially different from the first and dismissed Trump's case with prejudice, which allowed the subpoena to be executed. He concluded: "Justice requires an end to this controversy." 
Appeal to Federal Court
On the next day, August 21, Trump's lawyers filed an emergency request with a federal appeals court to put the subpoena on hold, but the court denied his request that same day. Instead, the court granted him a hearing that was scheduled for September 1, but meanwhile, the subpoena remained in force. Trump's accounting records could have been given to the New York State grand jury before the hearing took place, but that did not happen. The appeals court ruled unanimously on October 7, 2020, to deny Trump's objection and ordered the subpoena to be obeyed.
Appeal to Supreme Court
Trump had stated his intent to appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court and was granted 12 days in which to do so and prosecutors delayed execution of the subpoena. On October 13, 2020, Trump submitted a petition to the Supreme Court for a stay pending its review of the appeals court decision. 
On February 22, 2021, the Supreme Court denied the stay request, clearing the path for Trump’s tax records as well as other records to be released to prosecutors for review by a grand jury.
Disclosure of records
Within hours of the Supreme Court’s ruling, Mazars handed over to Vance millions of pages of documents containing Trump's tax returns from January 2011 to August 2019, as well as financial statements, engagement agreements, documents relating to the preparation and review of tax returns, and work papers and communications related to the tax returns.
On February 23, 2021, the House Oversight and Reform Committee in the 117th Congress, reissued its subpoena to Mazars seeking the same documents as had been provided to Vance, and which it had previously sought and been unable to obtain in Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP.

From "Trupiano v. United States" ==> """
Trupiano v. United States, 334 U.S. 699 (1948), was a US Supreme Court decision that ruled that warrantless searches following arrests were unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
The case involved a warrantless raid by law enforcement on an illegal distillery, before which law enforcement had had sufficient time to obtain warrants but had chosen not to. After the raid, evidence was seized. In a majority opinion authored by Justice Frank Murphy, the Court ruled that this seizure had been a violation of the Fourth Amendment:
It is a cardinal rule that, in seizing goods and articles, law enforcement agents must secure and use search warrants whenever reasonably practicable. This rule rests upon the desirability of having magistrates rather than police officers determine when searches and seizures are permissible and what limitations should be placed upon such activities. 
Trupiano was overturned only two years later in United States v. Rabinowitz (1950), which allowed law enforcement to search and seize evidence at the site of an arrest.

From "TRW Inc. v. Andrews" ==> """
TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19 (2001), is a United States Supreme Court decision holding that the discovery rule (that a federal statute of limitations begins to run when a party knows or has reason to know that she was injured) does not apply to the two-year statute of limitations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act..CRS Report RS21083, Identity Theft and the Fair Credit Reporting Act: An Analysis of TRW v. Andrews and Current Legislation (January 5, 2004). 
Background
The plaintiff in TRW v. Andrews was a victim of identity theft. An imposter, who had the same last name and first initial as the plaintiff, obtained Andrews’ social security number and attempted to open numerous credit accounts under the imposter’s name. On four occasions, the creditors responding to the impostor’s applications sought reports from the credit reporting division of TRW, which later became Experian. TRW matched the social security number, last name, and first initial with Andrews’ file and disclosed her credit history to the creditors. 
Andrews did not learn of the disclosures until she attempted to refinance her home and requested a copy of her credit report, which reflected the impostor’s activity. TRW corrected Andrews’ file when notified of the mistakes. However, Andrews alleged that the blemishes on her credit report “forced her to abandon her refinancing efforts and settle for an alternative line of credit on less favorable terms.”Andrews, 534 U.S. at 24.
Procedural history
Andrews filed suit against TRW on October 21, 1996, approximately 17 months after she became aware of the inaccurate information on her credit report and more than two years after TRW made the two initial disclosures. Andrews alleged that TRW’s failure to verify, prior to disclosing information to creditors, that she initiated the requests or was otherwise involved in the underlying transactions was in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act’s requirement that credit reporting agencies maintain reasonable procedures to avoid improper disclosures.Andrews, 534 U.S. at 25. Not relevant to the Supreme Court’s opinion was an additional claim by Andrews that TRW failed to “follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information” in the reports, in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681e(b).. This claim was resolved by a jury in favor of TRW.Andrews, 534 U.S. at 25, n. 3. By failing to verify that Andrews was the initiator of the requests, Andrews alleged that TRW facilitated the identity theft. She sought injunctive relief, punitive damages and other compensation.
TRW argued that Andrews’ claims based on the two earliest disclosures were barred because the Fair Credit Reporting Act’s two year statute of limitations had expired. Andrews countered that all of her claims were timely because the statute of limitations did not toll until the date she learned of the inaccurate disclosures. This argument was based upon Andrews’ contention that the FCRA incorporated a general federal rule which tolls the statute of limitations at the time the plaintiff becomes aware of the injury.
The District Court agreed with TRW, and held that a general federal discovery rule was not incorporated into the Fair Credit Reporting Act, thus barring Andrews’ claims based on the two earliest disclosures. The District Court also granted TRW’s motion for summary judgment on the two remaining claims, finding that TRW had maintained adequate procedures to avoid improper disclosures.Andrews, 7 F. Supp. 2d at 1068-1071. 
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court, applying the “general federal rule . . . that a federal statute of limitations begins to run when a party knows or has reason to know that she was injured.” The Ninth Circuit rejected the District Court’s assertion that the text of 15 U.S.C. 1681p,. including the exception to the commencement 
of the statute of limitations, precluded the application of general federal discovery rules, holding that “unless Congress has expressly legislated otherwise the equitable doctrine of discovery is read into every federal statute of limitations.”Andrews, 225 F.3d at 1067.  The court concluded that since the Fair Credit Reporting Act contained no express legislative directive the general rule applied, thus the statute of limitations had not expired on any of Andrews’ claims.Andrews, 225 F.3d at 1066.  TRW appealed to the Supreme Court
Opinion of the court
The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit’s decision, stating that the Ninth Circuit “conspicuously overstated” the scope and force of the presumption that general discovery rules apply unless Congress has expressly legislated otherwise.Andrews, 534 U.S. at 27.  The Court said that while some lower federal courts have applied a general discovery rule when a statute is silent on the issue, the Supreme Court has not adopted that position. Furthermore, the Court stated that it had “never endorsed the Ninth Circuit’s view that Congress can convey its refusal to adopt a discovery rule only by explicit command, rather than by implication from the structure or text of the particular 
statute.”Andrews, 534 U.S. at 27-28.
While the Ninth Circuit correctly noted that the Fair Credit Reporting Act contains no specific directive against the application of general federal discovery rules, the Court noted that the statute does set forth a specific statute of limitations, along with a single exception to the general rule. Based upon the text and structure of the statute in question, the Supreme Court determined that Congress’ “intent to preclude judicial implication of a discovery rule” was clear.Andrews, 534 U.S. at 28.  Citing an earlier case, the Court held that “[w]here Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.”Andrews, 534 U.S. at 28, citing . Applying general principles of statutory construction, the Court reasoned that “Congress implicitly excluded a general discovery rule by explicitly including a more limited one.”  To allow the incorporation of a general rule in light of this fact, would have the practical effect of rendering the stated exception to the general rule “entirely superfluous in all but the most unusual circumstances,” thus violating a “cardinal principal of statutory construction” - that “a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant.”Andrews, 534 U.S. at 29-31 (citations omitted).
As if anticipating the Court’s decision, Andrews argued that if the statute of limitations was to commence on the date on which liability arises, the date should be the date on which the inaccuracies come to the attention of the potential plaintiff, rather than the date on which the credit reporting agency made the inaccurate disclosure.Andrews, 534 U.S. at 32. Andrews relied on legislative history pointing to Congress’ consideration of alternative language in making her argument. The Court rejected Andrews’ reliance on legislative history noting that TRW was able to present information to the contrary.Andrews, 534 U.S. at 33.  
The Court also rejected Andrews’ argument that liability did not arise until actual damages materialized. Refusing to address the issue because it was not raised earlier, the Court doubted that the argument would have aided Andrews because Andrews’ alleged damages began to materialize when the inaccurate disclosures were made, causing the statute of limitations to toll at the same time as under the statutory language in question.Andrews, 534 U.S. at 33-34. 
By reversing the Ninth Circuit’s decision, the Supreme Court barred Andrews’ claims based upon the two earliest disclosures. The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion, presumably allowing Andrews to go forward with the other claims.

TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438 (1976),.  was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States articulated the requirement of materiality in securities fraud cases.
Facts and procedural history
National Industries, Inc. sought to acquire TSC Industries, Inc., and  had purchased 34% of TSC's voting stock from the corporation’s founder.  Five nominees from National were placed on TSC's board of directors.  TSC's board voted on October 16, 1969 (with National's members abstaining) to liquidate and sell the assets of TSC to National.  One aspect of the proposed merger was to exchange both common and preferred in TSC for that of National.  TSC and National then issued a joint proxy statement to their shareholders to approve the merger.  The shareholders approved and the plan was carried out.
Plaintiff Northway, Inc. was a TSC shareholder who brought suit against both TSC and National, alleging that the proxy statement was incomplete and materially misleading and therefore violated §14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, , and Rules 14a-3 and 14a-9 promulgated thereunder by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.  Northway asserted that the proxy statement was misleading because National had omitted facts concerning the degree of control it had over TSC, and misrepresented whether or not the merger was a good deal for TSC shareholders.  The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois denied Northway's motion for summary judgment.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed with the District Court that there existed a genuine issue of fact as to whether National's acquisition of the Schmidt interests in TSC had resulted in a change of control, and that summary judgment was therefore inappropriate on the Rule 14a-3 claim. But the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's denial of summary judgment to Northway on its Rule 14a-9 claims, holding that certain omissions of fact were material as a matter of law. 512 F.2d 324 (1975). The U.S. Supreme Court then granted certiorari.
Decision
Justice Marshall, writing for the majority, first examined the underlying policy behind the §14a of the Securities Exchange Act.  Stockholders need to understand the questions they are voting on, and misstatements or omissions in proxy materials prevent them from properly doing so.  The court had previously held that a defect in a proxy statement need not be decisive in the actual vote:  so long as the misstatement or omission was material, there was a causal link between violation of the law and the injury to the shareholder.
Previous standards of materiality
Marshall then examined the various standards of materiality which had been used by lower courts.  The Seventh Circuit used the test of “all facts which a reasonable shareholder might consider important”, which Marshall held was not a stringent enough test.  The Second and Fifth circuits used a more conventional tort-based test:  whether a reasonable person would attach importance to the fact which was misrepresented or omitted in determining his course of action.
Marshall's new formulation of materiality
Marshall wanted the test for materiality of a misstatement or omission to serve the remedial purposes of §14a, without creating too much liability for companies by allowing any minor or trivial defect to create liability.  If the test was too stringent, it would cause the dismissal of otherwise meritorious lawsuits; if it were too lenient, corporate officers would be inclined to overwhelm shareholders with such a large volume of information that truly valuable facts might escape them.  He formulated the test as follows:  an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.  In other words, the court must determine whether under all the circumstances, the omitted fact would have assumed actual significance in the decision of the shareholder.  Thus, materiality is a mixed question of fact and law.
Application of the new rule to the facts of the case
The two facts that National omitted with respect to the proxy solicitation were the fact that National's chief executive officer was chairman of TSC's board of directors, and that National had previously indicated to the SEC that it was the parent company of TSC.  Marshall held that these omissions were of questionable materiality and inappropriate for summary judgment because other disclosures within the proxy materials could have led shareholders to similar conclusions about the degree of control National exercised over TSC.  Furthermore, there was already a genuine issue of fact as to whether National was really in control of TSC at the time of the proxy solicitation anyway.
The two facts which National omitted with respect to the fairness of the transaction were the statements of an investment banking firm involved in the deal and the purchase of National's stock by a mutual fund.  The investment bank rendered an opinion that the high redemption price of National's stock was a substantial premium over the current market value of TSC's shares.  The bank later revised its opinion when it discovered that the warrants for National stock were being offered at a lower price than expected.  But since the bank still felt the transaction was fair and that TSC shareholders were still receiving a premium, Marshall held this omission to be immaterial.
Northway also accused National of collusion to manipulate market prices by engaging in a series of transactions with Madison Fund, Inc., a mutual fund.  One of National's directors also had a seat on Madison's board, and in the period prior to National's acquisition of TSC, Madison's purchases of National's common stock accounted for 8.5% of all reported transactions for the company's securities.  But Northway failed to demonstrate evidence of any unlawful manipulation at trial, and Marshall found that National had no duty to disclose all information which might suggest market manipulation, but rather only to be honest in its disclosures.  Marshall overturned the decision of the Court of Appeals and remanded the case.

From "Tucker v. Texas" ==> """
Tucker v. Texas, 326 U.S. 517 (1946), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a state statute making it an offense to distribute literature in a federal government-owned town was an improper restriction on freedom of the press and religion..
Background
History
Tucker was an ordained minister of the group known as Jehovah's Witnesses. In accordance with the practices of this group he called on people from door to door, presenting his religious views to those willing to listen, and distributes religious literature to those willing to receive it. In the course of his work, he went to the Hondo Navigation Village located on the Hondo Army Airfield in Medina County, Texas. The village was owned by the United States under a Congressional program which was designed to provide housing for persons engaged in National Defense activities. According to all indications the village was freely accessible and open to the public and had the characteristics of a typical American town.
The Federal Public Housing Authority had placed the buildings in charge of a manager whose duty it was to rent the houses, collect the rents, and generally to supervise operations, subject to over-all control by the Authority. He ordered Tucker to discontinue all religious activities in the village. Tucker refused. Later the manager ordered Tucker to leave the village. Insisting that the manager had no right to suppress religious activities, appellant declined to leave, and his arrest followed. At the trial the manager testified that the controlling Federal agency had given him full authority to regulate the conduct of those living in the village, and that he did not allow preaching by ministers of any denomination without a permit issued by him in his discretion. He thought this broad authority was entrusted to him, at least in part, by a regulation, which the Authority's Washington office had allegedly promulgated. He testified that this regulation provided that no peddlers or hawkers could come into or remain in the village without getting permission from the manager.
Lower courts
Tucker was charged in the Justice Court of Medina County with violating Article 479, Chap. 3 of the Texas Penal Code which makes it an offense for any 'peddler or hawker of goods or merchandise' willfully to refuse to leave premises after having been notified to do so by the owner or possessor thereof. Tucker argued that he was not peddler or hawker of merchandise, but a minister of the gospel engaged in the distribution of religious literature to willing recipients. He contended that to construe the Texas statute as applicable to his activities would, to that extent, bring it into conflict with the Constitutional guarantees of freedom of press and religion.  His contention was rejected and he was convicted. On appeal to the Medina County Court, his Constitutional argument was again overruled.
Direct appeal to U.S. Supreme Court
At the time, Texas law did not provide for a subsequent appeal to a higher state court.  Under 28 U.S.C. 344(a) (now at ), the United States Supreme Court has jurisdiction to hear an appeal when there is no higher state court authorized to review the case.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case.
Opinion of the Court
thumb|left|100px|alt=Justice Hugo Black portrait|Justice Hugo Black, author of majority opinion
Justice Hugo Black delivered the opinion of the court.  Black referred to Marsh v. Alabama, Marsh v. Alabama,  which was decided during the same term.  In that case, the court had held that a state trespassing statute could not be used to prevent the distribution of religious literature by requiring a permit in a company town.  Black noted that the only difference here was that the Marsh case involved a privately owned town and the current case involved a town owned by the federal government.  Black allowed that there might be a case where it might be proper for security reasons to prohibit outsiders from entering such a housing area, but that did not apply in this case.  The case was reversed and remanded.
Concurrence
thumb|right|100px|alt=Justice Felix Frankfurter portrait|Justice Felix Frankfurter, author of concurring opinion
Justice Felix Frankfurter issued a concurring opinion.  Frankfurter noted that since the town was owned by the government rather than a private company, the government was held a higher requirement not to infringe on basic freedoms than a company.  He also noted that this did not involve an act of Congress.
Dissent
thumb|left|100px|alt=Chief Justice Harlan Stone portrait|Justice Harlan Stone, author of dissenting opinion
Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone, Justice Stanley F. Reed and Justice Harold H. Burton construed this case as showing a conviction for refusing, at the request of its authorized agent, to leave premises which are owned by the United States and which have not been shown to be dedicated to general use by the public. They, therefore, would have upheld the conviction for the reasons given in the dissent in Marsh.
Subsequent developments
This case was one of a series of cases known as the Jehovah's Witnesses cases that clarified the Free Exercise Clause.  Those cases were heard primarily from the late 1930s to the mid-1940s.McAninch, William Shepard (1987), "A Catalyst for the Evolution of Constitutional Law: Jehovah's Witnesses in the Supreme Court", University of Cincinnati Law Review, 55 U. Cin. L. Rev. 997  These cases also had a major role in enforcing the Bill of Rights against the states via the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Like Tucker, most of these cases dealt with the distribution of religious literature and door-to-door preaching.  Prior to these cases, the court had applied the clear and present danger test developed by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. to constitutional issues, but beginning with these cases, they begin to apply the strict scrutiny test.Flynn, Patrick J. (2004), "'Writing their Faith into the Laws of the Land:' Jehovah's Witnesses and the Supreme Court's Battle for the Meaning of the Free Exercise Clause, 1939-1945", Texas Journal on Civil Liberties & Civil Rights, 1 Tex.

The Tucson Five was a group of house-mates from Los Angeles who were, despite a lack of evidence, alleged by the FBI to have been participants in the Weather Underground. Their case is notable because of the way in which grand jury proceedings and contempt of court charges were used against the group by Guy L.

From "Tulee v. Washington" ==> """
Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. 681 (1942), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held the Washington statute prescribing license fees for fishing is invalid as applied to a Yakima Indian convicted on a charge of catching salmon with a net without first having obtained a license, in view of the Treaty with Yakima Indians securing to them the exclusive right of taking fish in all streams running through or bordering reservation and right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places in common with citizens of Washington.
 Background 
Sampson Tulee was a Yakama Indian who was arrested in 1939 for fishing for salmon with a net, without a state license.  Tulee contended that the 1855 treaty gave him the right to fish, while the state contended that this right was limited to the reservation.  Tulee was convicted in state court and his conviction was affirmed at the Washington Supreme Court.Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. 681, 682 (1942); ,  142 (2006).
 Supreme Court 
Justice Hugo Black delivered the opinion of the court.  Black found that the terms of the treaty granted tribal members fishing rights both on and off of the reservation.  The state was not allowed to charge fees for Indians to be able to exercise those rights.  He noted that the court had clearly ruled on fishing rights in United States v. Winans in 1905 and in Seufert Bros. Co. v. United States in 1919.  The court therefore ruled that the state was without power to regulate tribal fishing.Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. at 685; , at 142.
 Subsequent developments 
Although the tribe had won the case, they still faced discrimination from the state and from non-Indian commercial fishermen.  It was not until 1974 when U.S. District Judge George Boldt ruled on the discrimination in United States v. Washington. He later ordered the United States Coast Guard to enforce his order that the state began to revise its methods, and the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed his decision in Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association (1979).,  230-32 (2000).

From "Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen" ==> """
Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, 323 U.S. 210 (1944), is a 1944 Supreme Court case. It involved a black man, Tom Tunstall, who was unfairly dismissed from his job because of his race.
Background
Plaintiff Tom Tunstall was a locomotive fireman, employed by the defendant company, Norfolk Southern Railway Company and its predecessor Norfolk Southern Railroad Company (both hereinafter called the Railway) on or prior to March 28, 1940. The plaintiff was rendered ineligible for membership in the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen (hereinafter called the Brotherhood) solely because of his race. On or about March 28, 1940, the Brotherhood initiated negotiations with the defendant Railway and other carriers. As a result, there was a collective bargaining agreement dated February 18, 1941. And ever since the beginning of the negotiations with the Railway until the result of the collective bargaining agreement, the Brotherhood has claimed to be the exclusive bargaining representative under the Railway Labor Act 48 Stat. 1185, 45 U. S. C. §§ 151 et seq. Case summary page
thumb|right|200px|Logo of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, established in 1873, known as the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen from 1907.
In other words, when a labor union is certified as bargaining agent under the Railway Labor Act, it becomes the exclusive bargaining representative for the entire craft or class of the employees. 
Consequently, minority members of the bargaining unit can neither choose another representative of their choice nor engage in individual, independent bargaining. This would then often lead to less power for them due to the fact that their interests would not be properly represented by the bargaining representative and thus they have no choice but to remain without proper representation. 
During the entire time under consideration in this case, the Brotherhood maintained that the employment rights of the plaintiff and the class represented by him are governed by the said collective bargaining agreement dated February 18, 1941. The Brotherhood initiated the negotiations without notifying the plaintiff, Tom Tunstall, or any other members of his class.Houston opposes review of Tom Tunstall's case. (December 13, 1947). Afro-American (1893-1988) Retrieved from 
The Railway and the other carriers protested against the negotiations proposed by the Brotherhood and the Brotherhood invoked the services of the National Mediation Board without giving notice of such action to the plaintiff or any other members of his class. Moreover, the Brotherhood did not notify the plaintiff or any other members of his class after the execution of the contracts that such agreements had been executed. Plaintiff Tunstall claimed that he suffered because of the Brotherhood’s modifications to the collective bargaining agreement.
As a result of the negotiations, Tunstall was deprived of his seniority and rights by being removed from his job as a fireman. Instead, he was assigned more difficult and arduous work at a lower wage and was replaced by a white member of the brotherhood. This situation left the black firemen and enginemen voiceless and thus powerless, basically unable to protect their rights. Therefore, the plaintiff brought suit for declaratory judgment, injunction, and damages on account of discriminatory contract in favor of white members and against black members of the craft.
However, the Fourth Circuit at the Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case on the ground that the federal courts lacked the jurisdiction over the case. The plaintiff therefore appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court reversed the dismissal of the Circuit Court and granted a writ of certiorari.
Opinion of the Court
Mr. Charles H. Houston for plaintiff, Tom Tunstall.
Mr. Harold C. Heiss for respondent, The Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen.
Chief Justice Stone delivered the opinion of the Court, which held that the Railway Labor Act imposed on unions a "duty to exercise fairly the power conferred upon it in [sic] behalf of all those for whom it acts, without hostile discrimination against them."Steele v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., 323 U.S. 192, 203 (1944) The Court outlined the Railway Labor Act's duty in its Steele opinion, and adopted it by reference in Tunstall, dedicating the balance of the Tunstall opinion to discussing whether a class action for an injunction under the Act poses a federal question. Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen & Enginemen, 323 U.S. 210, 211-14 (1944) (answering the federal question issue in the affirmative). This duty defined by the Court required that the Brotherhood, as an exclusive bargaining agent, was required "in collective bargaining and in making contracts with the carrier, to represent non-union or minority union members of the craft without hostile discrimination, fairly, impartially, and in good faith."Steele, 323 U.S. at 204.
Although the Court never specifically stated the magic words, this good faith duty has become widely recognized as the "duty of fair representation."Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen & Enginemen, 323 U.S. 210, 211-14 (1944) The Court opinion emphasized that it was especially concerned with the problem of economic hardships that would have resulted by the Railway Labor Act. The Court commented, "the minority would be left with no means of protecting their interests or, indeed, their right to earn a livelihood by pursuing the occupation in which they are employed."Steele, 323 U.S. at 201.
Justice Frank Murphy’s concurring opinion explicitly advocated the strength of Houston’s Realist arguments.Realist argument, as described by Professor Bell, was designed to work in such a manner by pointing judges towards the unique factual and ethical issues of each case, while overlaying the economic and political implications of the judge's decision. Bell, supra note 12, at 367. Justice Murphy commented that "the utter disregard for the dignity and the well-being of colored citizens shown by this record is so pronounced as to demand the invocation of constitutional condemnation."Id. at 208 (Murphy, J., concurring). He did not hesitate to criticize the majority for failing to candidly confront the issues that Houston raised; "to decide the case and to analyze the statute solely upon the basis of legal niceties, while remaining mute and placid as to the obvious and oppressive deprivation of constitutional guarantees, is to make the judicial function something less than it should be."Id. at 208 (Murphy, J., concurring).
Justice Murphy even advocated that a clearer and stronger message be sent by the Court:
No statutory interpretation can erase this ugly example of economic cruelty against colored citizens of the United States. Nothing can destroy the fact that the accident of birth has been used as the basis to abuse individual rights… [a] sound democracy cannot allow such discrimination to go unchallenged. Racism is far too virulent today to permit the slightest refusal … to expose and condemn it wherever it appears in the course of a statutory interpretation.(n79  Id. at 209.)
In conclusion, the Court announced that the duty of the certified collective bargaining agent to represent the members of unions fairly and without racial discrimination when negotiating a bargaining agreement was implicit in the Railway Labor Act.Black Labor and the American Legal System: Race, Work, and the Law, By Herbert Hill  Therefore, the Court is of opinion that the record clearly demonstrates that the motion of the plaintiff for summary judgment should be granted and the motions of the defendants for summary judgments should be denied
Legacy
By winning this case before the US Supreme Court, Attorney Houston made a unique contribution for the rights of minorities in the area of labor law. The strategy of legal Realism implemented by Houston in this case, with analysis of the lasting ramifications emanating from, is worth noting. This case is one of many other cases within the larger history of civil rights Houston pursued in the courts. His involvement in the issues facing African-American union members began with the Colored Railway Trainmen and Locomotive Firemen’s Local No.5. The facts presented to him by Tunstall v. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen were "reflective of the ubiquity of discrimination" put against African Americans in unions.

From "Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC" ==> """
Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission, 512 U.S. 622 (1994), is the first of two United States Supreme Court cases dealing with the must-carry rules imposed on cable television companies. Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission (II), 520 U.S. 180 (1997) was the second.  Turner I established that cable television companies were indeed First Amendment speakers but didn't decide whether the federal regulation of their speech infringed upon their speech rights. In Turner II the court decided that the must-carry provisions were constitutional.
Under the Miami Herald v. Tornillo case, it was unconstitutional to force a newspaper to run a story the editors would not have included absent a government statute because it was compelled speech which could not pass the strict scrutiny of a compelling state interest being achieved with the least restrictive means necessary to achieve the state interest. However, under the rule of Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC the High Court held that a federal agency could regulate broadcast stations (TV and radio) with far greater discretion.  In order for federal agency regulation of broadcast media to pass constitutional muster, it need only serve an important state interest and need not narrowly tailor its regulation to the least restrictive means.

From "Turner v. Rogers" ==> """
Turner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431 (2011), is a case that was decided by the United States Supreme Court on June 20, 2011, relating to the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. The Court held that Turner was not entitled to a public defender in cases regarding family nonsupport. However, in cases in which a state is not required to provide counsel, it must provide some other safeguard to reduce the risk of erroneous deprivation of liberty in civil contempt cases. The particular case the Court took under review was a child support payment case and the point of contention was the process of the defendant's income determination by the court.
Background
Michael D. Turner, the petitioner, was jailed six times between 2003 and 2010 for accumulated child support payment arrears.  The duration of Turner's jail spells ranged from one day to eight months. A person being in arrears on child support payments is not unusual: in 2008, 11.2 million U.S. child support cases had arrears due.U.S. Office of Child Support Enforcement, FY 2008 Annual Report to Congress, Table 73. The number of persons kept in jail or in prison for child support arrears is not generally tracked. Based on a publicly available collection of relevant data, an estimated 50,000 persons are kept in jail or in prison on any given day in the U.S. for child support arrears.Galbi, Douglas. "Persons in Jail or in Prison for Child-Support Debt," published Mar. 22, 2011. Additionally, over $100 billion in child support payments is overdue.
During his most recent term in prison, Turner appealed his sentencing, claiming that he was entitled to counsel at his hearing. Before the case was heard by the South Carolina Supreme Court, however, Turner's sentence expired, and the South Carolina Supreme Court subsequently rejected the claim, distinguishing between civil contempt and criminal contempt, arguing that counsel was only required for the latter. Turner's pro bono counsel then appealed the case on Turner's behalf to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Questions presented
Whether the Supreme Court of South Carolina erred in holding—in conflict with twenty-two federal courts of appeals and state courts of last resort-that an indigent defendant has no constitutional right to appointed counsel at a civil contempt proceeding that results in his incarceration
Whether the Court has jurisdiction to review the decision of the South Carolina Supreme Court.
Ruling
In a 5–4 decision written by Justice Stephen Breyer, the Court first rejected the claim of mootness by South Carolina, reasoning that the period of Turner's sentence was too short to allow for full adjudication of the sentence prior to expiration and that the likelihood of Turner being subjected to civil contempt proceedings again rendered the claim not moot (distinguishing this case from DeFunis v. Odegaard). On the merits, Justice Breyer held that a state is under no obligation to provide a public defender to indigent respondents in civil contempt cases, especially if the plaintiff is also not represented by counsel. However, Justice Breyer noted that the South Carolina courts were under an obligation to provide an alternative procedure to ensure a fair determination of the case. Since Turner did not have clear notice that "ability to pay" would be the critical question in this proceeding, nor was he provided with information or forms that would have allowed Turner to disclose such information, the South Carolina courts erred in finding him able to pay and subsequently holding him in civil contempt.. Justice Breyer stated:
Third, as the Solicitor General points out, there is available a set of “substitute procedural safeguards,” Mathews, 424 U.S., at 335, 96S.Ct. 893, which, if employed together, can significantly reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation of liberty. They can do so, moreover, without incurring some of the drawbacks inherent in recognizing an automatic right to counsel. Those safeguards include (1) notice to the defendant that his “ability to pay” is a critical issue in the contempt proceeding; (2) the use of a form (or the equivalent) to elicit relevant financial information; (3) an opportunity at the hearing for the defendant to respond to statements and questions about his financial status, (e.g., those triggered by his responses on the form); and (4) an express finding by the court that the defendant has the ability to pay.Turner, 564 U.S. at 447-48.
Justice Breyer went on to reiterate what Due Process requires in lieu of appointment of counsel in civil proceedings:
We consequently hold that the Due Process Clause does not automatically require the provision of counsel at civil contempt proceedings to an indigent individual who is subject to a child support order, even if that individual faces incarceration (for up to a year). In particular, that Clause does not require the provision of counsel where the opposing parent or other custodian (to whom support funds are owed) is not represented by counsel and the State provides alternative procedural safeguards equivalent to those we have mentioned (adequate notice of the importance of ability to pay, fair opportunity to present, and to dispute, relevant information and court findings).Turner, 564 U.S. at 448.
Thus, there must be notice to the obligor-parent that his/her ability to pay is at issue. Then there must be forms designed to elicit this information and a consideration by the court of the obligor-parent's ability to pay. After this, courts are then required to make a specific finding in child support contempt cases whether or not the obligor-parent has or had the ability to pay in order to satisfy Due Process.
However, Justice Breyer specifically declined to address whether Due Process would require the appointment of counsel in complex cases or when the state is collecting support payments overdue to the state, because in the scenario the state would be represented by counsel. Breyer seemed to recognize that the "average defendant" probably lacks the skill to adequately defend themselves. Breyer quoted from Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 462–463, 58S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938), stating with emphasis:  
([T]he average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to protect himself when brought before a tribunal with power to take his life or liberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned counsel (emphasis added)). And this kind of proceeding is not before us. Neither do we address what due process requires in an unusually complex case where a defendant can fairly be represented only by a trained advocate.Turner, 564 U.S. at 449.
Dissent
Justice Clarence Thomas authored a dissenting opinion, arguing that the majority ruled on grounds never raised by the parties during litigation. He noted that the Fourteenth Amendment never provided for alternative safeguards to ensure that protections under the Fourteenth Amendment were not violated, and that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel only applies to criminal prosecutions and not civil cases. Thomas further argued that the majority opinion did not consider the effects of this decision with respect to child support payments, and expressed concern that the majority opinion would undermine state efforts to collect child support payments.
Legacy
Because states are free to provide constitutional protections greater than those provided by the federal government under the United States Constitution, the Turner ruling did not overturn the requirements of many states that counsel be appointed for indigent litigants facing incarceration at civil contempt hearings.
The federal agency responsible for enforcing child support is the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE). In response to the Turner decision, OCSE responded that states should review their procedures to ensure that the proceedings are fair by giving the obligor-parents an opportunity to provide and respond to questions regarding their finances and ability to pay. The Office of Child Support Enforcement Commissioner's blog states:
As a result of the Turner v. Rogers decision, state child support agencies and courts are examining their civil contempt procedures. The goal is not to eliminate contempt procedures in cases where it may be appropriate, but instead to implement fair and cost-effective procedures that assure that families receive reliable child support payments, improve fairness and access to justice for parents without an attorney, and reduce the need for jail time. Incarceration may indeed be appropriate in those cases where noncustodial parents can afford to support their children but willfully evade their parental responsibilities by hiding income and assets. However, jail is not appropriate for noncustodial parents who do not have the means to pay their child support debts. The first step to reducing the need for contempt hearings is to set accurate child support orders. The research is clear that setting realistic orders based on actual income can actually improve compliance, increasing both the amount of child support collected and the consistency of payment. The research says that compliance falls off when orders are set above 15 to 20 percent of a noncustodial parent’s income.The decision in Turner has also provided reasoning to legal commentators who assume that incarceration for nonsupport is a civil punishment and not criminal in nature. Critiques of the case's holding point to the often devastating and disparate impact of child support enforcement on poor and minority fathers and their families. Scholars also argue that the Turner decision allowed state courts to relabel criminal punishments as civil ones, allowing limitation and circumvention of constitutionally mandated procedural protections. Prior to this case, South Carolina established domestic relations courts that increasingly used civil contempt as opposed to criminal statutes to incarcerate debtors. The "alternative procedural safeguards" advanced by the Turner majority has done little in the way of protecting indigent parents in contempt proceedings.

From "Turner v. Safley" ==> """
Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), was a U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the constitutionality of two Missouri prison regulations. One of the prisoners' claims related to the fundamental right to marry, and the other related to freedom of speech (in sending/receiving letters). The court held that a regulation preventing inmates from marrying without permission violated their constitutional right to marry because it was not logically related to a legitimate penological concern, but a prohibition on inmate-to-inmate correspondence was justified by prison security needs..
The case has been cited as precedent, establishing the "Turner Test" for constitutional challenges to prison regulations. According to the test, a prison regulation is constitutional if it satisfies four factors:
 There is a rational connection to a legitimate government interest;
 There are alternative means for prisoners to exercise their right(s);
 Accommodation of the right(s) would have excessive "ripple effects"; and
 There are no "ready alternatives."
This test has been used for decades by US courts, but it has also been criticized by legal scholars for being too deferential to prison administrators.
 Background 
The Renz Correctional Institution, at the time a prison of the Missouri Department of Corrections (MODOC, then called the Missouri Division of Corrections) near Jefferson City, transitioned in 1975 from being a men's prison to housing both male and female inmates. It was there that two inmates, a man named Leonard Safley and a woman named Pearl Jane "P.J." Watson, met and began a relationship. There was an unwritten rule at the time that if two inmates developed a "close" or "physical" relationship, one would be transferred to another facility.Safley v. Turner, 586 F. Supp. 589 (W.D. Mo. 1984) After an incident that the trial court would describe as "a noisy lover's quarrel," Safley was transferred to the Ozark Correctional Center at Fordland, Missouri. Safley attempted to keep in touch with Watson by mail, but staff at Renz consistently prevented it from arriving. Safley tried using the pseudonym "Jack King," or having friends send letters on his behalf, but only a few of these made it to Watson.
Mail between inmates in different facilities was subject to divisional regulation 20-118.010(e), a rule that always allowed mail between family members or related to legal matters, but said other mail "may be allowed" if prison staff believed it was "in the best interest of the parties involved." Enforcement of this rule was inconsistent and varied by facility; in practice, Renz inmates were not allowed to send or receive mail from non-family inmates at other facilities without prior approval. Renz was the only facility in the state with an effective total ban.
Additionally, inmate marriages were restricted at Renz. At the time, regulation 20.117.050 did not authorize facility superintendents to prohibit inmate marriages, though they were not obligated to assist with them either. However, Renz's superintendent did regularly deny permission for inmates to marry, especially female inmates. After this litigation was filed, in December 1983, MODOC put out a new regulation which put a burden of proof on inmates to convince their superintendent that there was a "compelling reason" to allow them to marry. This did not make much difference at Renz, as the superintendent continued to deny permission to female inmates in most cases, stating that it was not in their "best interest."
As the end of Safley's sentence grew near, and he was transferred to a halfway house, he tried to visit Watson, but was denied permission when he arrived at Renz. MODOC rules prohibited former inmates from visiting prisons until six months after release. The two also wanted to get married, but were denied permission.
 Proceedings in lower courts 
 District Court 
In 1981, they filed a lawsuit in the Western District of Missouri challenging the constitutionality of the restrictions on inmate mail, marriage, and visitation. In March 1982, during a preliminary injunction hearing, Safley's attorney Floyd Finch suggested to the Judge, Howard Sachs, that Safley and Watson could get married right then and there in court. Sachs allowed it over the objection of the state's attorney, seeing "no 'substantial state interest' in preventing it," and the newlyweds were allowed to sit together for 10 minutes.
This rendered their individual claim about the marriage restriction moot, but the case was certified as a class action and continued. A five-day trial was held in February 1984, and in May 1984 a ruling was issued that overturned the restrictions on mail and marriage, but left the visitation rule intact. As visitation was not nearly as important a right as the rights of marriage and free speech, the visitation rule was upheld "as a matter of legitimate discretion."
On the other hand, Judge Sachs' ruling applied strict scrutiny to the mail and marriage rules. The rationale offered by MODOC witnesses for the mail rule was discouraging the formation of inmate gangs, and preventing coordination of riots, escapes, etc.Safley v. Turner, 777 F.2d 1307 (8th Cir. 1985) Sachs noted that in Procunier v. MartinezProcunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 (1974) the Supreme Court had refrained from crafting a specific standard for mail between inmates, but after discussing various other opinions by appellate courts, he ruled that the mail regulations were "unnecessarily sweeping", and were therefore unconstitutional.
For the marriage rule, he relied on cases such as Zablocki v. Redhail and Loving v. Virginia that held marriage to be a fundamental human right. In his findings of fact, the judge found that the superintendent, out of an apparent "protective attitude", denied permission for female inmates to marry except where there was a birth or a pregnancy. Even though incarceration came with the loss of certain rights and freedoms, Sachs wrote,
 Court of Appeals 
MODOC appealed the ruling to a three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the trial court was wrong about the appropriate standard of review, and was clearly erroneous in its finding of fact. The Court disagreed, and affirmed the rulings of the trial court. It spent very little time discussing the "clearly erroneous" argument, simply noting that after reviewing the "entire record," they found "substantial evidence to support each finding of fact."
With respect to the mail rule, MODOC argued that that plaintiffs' status as inmates meant that the regulation should be review under a rational basis standard, rather than strict scrutiny. MODOC compared their rule to other prison rules which had been upheld, but the Court distinguished them as a "time, place, or manner" rules (as with Pell v. ProcunierPell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817 (1974) and Bell v. Wolfish,Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 etc.), or as barely affecting freedom of speech (as with Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor UnionJones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, 433 U.S. 119 (1977)). In contrast, an 8th Circuit case, Gregory v. Auger,Gregory v. Auger, 768 F.2d 287 (8th Cir. 1985) had treated restriction on inmate mail as "a serious infringement of First Amendment liberties." As this case squarely dealt with speech, and finding no precedent in either Supreme Court or 8th Circuit caselaw to support a lower standard of review for prison rules on free speech, the Court upheld the application of strict scrutiny and the trial court's finding that the rule was unconstitutional.
In considering the marriage rule, the Court noted testimony from Superintendent Turner that, even before the new rule in 1983, "he believed he had the inherent power to deny permission [to marry] by virtue of Missouri statutes 'which allow me to control my institution.'" MODOC also argued that they had an interest in preventing "love triangles", which could lead to fights. The substance of MODOC's legal argument was again comparison to restrictions that had been upheld, and an argument that a lower level of scrutiny was appropriate. The Court found, however, that the other examples still left alternative ways for prisoners to exercise their rights, but "[h]ere, in contrast, both the old marriage rule as it was applied by Superintendent Turner and the 1983 rule on its face absolutely prevent those inmates denied permission from getting married." As the right to marriage was a "well settled" fundamental right, the Court again affirmed the lower court's reasoning and ultimate verdict.
 Decision of the Supreme Court 
 The Turner test 
Writing for a five-justice majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor began by examining the precedent set by Procunier v. Martinez, and determining the appropriate level of scrutiny for judicial review of prison regulations. The Court in Martinez had stated, ". . .federal courts must take cognizance of the valid constitutional claims of prison inmates," but also said that "courts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform." Thus, there were competing interests of justice, and O'Connor argued that courts should tread carefully:
O'Connor wrote that Martinez had not actually formulated a standard of review, and the lower courts had been incorrect to interpret it as imposing strict scrutiny in this case. Rather, Martinez had imposed strict scrutiny in a situation where inmate mail had been censored based on its content (mail was censored for statements that "unduly complain," "magnify grievances," or express "inflammatory political, racial, religious or other views"), and where the rights of non-inmates were also implicated. Whereas content-based regulation of speech by the general public was an easy case where strict scrutiny should be applied, the present case called for a new standard to be formulated.
Thus the Court formulated such a standard, which would come to be known as the Turner test. A prison regulation that affected inmates' constitutional rights "is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests," and reasonableness would be judged by four factors:
 Whether there is a “valid, rational connection” between the regulation and the legitimate governmental interest used to justify it;
 Whether there are alternative means for the prisoner to exercise the right at issue;
 The impact that the desired accommodation will have on guards, other inmates, and prison resources (so-called "ripple effects"); and
 The presence or absence of “ready alternatives," where the presence of ready alternatives make it more likely that a regulation is unreasonable, while the absence make it less likely that the regulation is unreasonable.
 The test applied to the mail rule 
Applying this test, the Court found MODOC's mail rule to be reasonable. It noted testimony by prison officials that gang activity was a growing problem in Missouri prisons, and that separating and isolating gang members was a well-known strategy. Renz was also sometimes used to put inmates in protective custody, which might be undermined by inmates communicating with other facilities. The first factor was thus satisfied. For the second factor, the Court said that inmates still had other forms of expression available, implicitly stating the ability to send and receive mail should not be considered in isolation. For the third factor, the Court felt that lower courts had underestimated the cost of allowing mail between inmates, especially because "exercise of the right affects the inmates and staff of more than one institution." The administrative cost of monitoring inmate communications, thwarting gangs, etc., would thus be increased across the state, not just at Renz. Finally, the Court stated that MODOC had "no obvious, easy alternatives to the policy [it] adopted. Other well-run prison systems, including the Federal Bureau of Prisons, have concluded that substantially similar restrictions on inmate correspondence were necessary to protect institutional order and security."
 The test applied to the marriage rule 
The Court began by affirming that inmates did indeed have a right to marry, a right previously recognized by cases such as Zablocki v. Redhail and Loving v. Virginia:
The Court then reviewed the reasons MODOC had given for its marriage rule (that love triangles could lead to fights, or that many female inmates needed to "develop[e] skills of self-reliance" because they had a history of abuse or were too reliant on men), and found them to have no reasonable relationship to the actual rule. As for the love triangles, "surely . . . inmate rivalries are as likely to develop without a formal marriage ceremony as with one." The proposition that female inmates needed to be more self-reliant in no way explaining why women's requests were routinely denied and men's were routinely granted, and was inconsistent with testimony that there were no recorded problems with such marriages before the 1983 rule was adopted. Moreover, while the Court did not deem this fact to be necessary for its holding, it did observe that this "rehabilitation" rationale was based on a suspect classification, as it only applied only to women, in a system of "excessive paternalism."
The Court thus overturned the marriage rule, but upheld the mail rule on its face, and remanded the case back to the court of appeals for a determination of whether the mail rule was "arbitrary and capricious" as applied.
 Concurrence in part and dissent in part 
Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, agreed with the majority's approach to the marriage rule, but disagreed with its analysis of the mail rule. He wrote,
One problem that Stevens had with the majority opinion is that it treated the plaintiff's case as only a facial challenge. He cited the original complaint and evidence from trial that discussed the ways that Renz's rules were different from every other facility in Missouri, and only paid lip service to some aspects of MODOC's state-wide standards. Both the trial court and the court of appeals, he argued, had properly grappled with the problems with Renz's rules as they were applied, and this was reflected in the injunctions and rulings they had issued. The majority, however, dealt only with MODOC's rules on their face, which clearly did not reflect the situation that had caused the plaintiffs to file their complaint.
Stevens also took issue with the way the majority handled the factual record of the case, with several assertions of fact (such as the gang problems, the availability of other means of expression, and the cost of reading all inmate mail) lacking "a sufficient basis in the record to support the Court's holding on the mail regulation."
For these reasons, although in theory the majority had developed a test and applied it to both the marriage rule and the mail rule, Stevens though their analysis of two rules was simply inconsistent:
 Subsequent developments 
Turner has been cited as precedent and is now considered to be part of a line of cases like Loving v. Virginia, Zablocki v. Redhail, and Obergefell v. Hodges, in which the Court has declared a fundamental right to marriage under the Fourteenth Amendment..

From "Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken" ==> """
Twentieth Century Music Corp v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151 (1975), was an important decision of the United States Supreme Court, out of the Third Circuit, that questioned whether the reception of a copyrighted song on a radio broadcast constitutes a copyright violation if the copyright owner has only licensed the broadcaster to "perform the composition publicly for profit".
Case summary
"George Aiken's Chicken" is a fast food restaurant in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, owned and operated by George Aiken. Food can be purchased and consumed inside of the store or ordered and taken out. Inside the store, radio station broadcasts are played over loud speakers that are audible to anyone in the restaurant. On March 11, 1972, two songs copyrighted by Twentieth Century Music Corp. were played over the radio and heard by customers in the restaurant. While the radio station broadcasting the songs was licensed by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) to play them, Aiken's establishment was not.
The petitioners of the case were Twentieth Century Music Corp., which owned the copyright to one of the songs, "The More I See You", and Mary Bourne, who owned the copyright to the other song, "Me and My Shadow". The petitioners claimed that Aiken's broadcast of their songs in his establishment violated their right to publicly perform their work for profit.  While the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania initially sided with the petitioners and required that Aiken provide monetary compensation for the copyright infringement, in 1975 the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit overturned the ruling, stating that the respondent did not infringe upon the petitioners' right under the Copyright Act "[t]o perform the copyrighted work publicly for profit" since the radio broadcast in the establishment was not equivalent to a "performance". A similar decision was made in earlier court cases such as Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists in 1968 and Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting in 1974.
Respondent did not infringe upon petitioners' exclusive right, under the Copyright Act, "[t]o perform the copyrighted work publicly for profit," since the radio reception did not constitute a "performance" of the copyrighted songs. Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists, 392 U.S. 390; Teleprompter Corp. v. CBS, 415 U.S. 394.
United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania
The District Judge ruled that Aiken did violate the petitioners' exclusive right to publicly perform their work for profit, and Aiken was ordered to pay monetary compensation to the copyright owners.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit overturned the previous ruling, stating that the petitioners' claims were already reviewed in Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists, 392 U. S. 390, and Teleprompter Corp. v. CBS, 415 U.S. 394.  It was decided that the radio reception did not constitute a performance of the copyrighted works.
Implications
The ruling in Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken holds with Congress' consistent interpretation of the Copyright Act. Congress was granted the power to create copyright law under the Constitution. According to the copyright legislation passed by Congress, it takes the interests of three main parties into consideration: authors, disseminators, and users. "Congress has repeatedly stated that the main purpose of the Copyright Act is the public good of use and access to works of art, even if such a public good comes at the expense of the author of the work."Webber, Amanda. "Digital Sampling and The Legal Implications of its Use After Bridgeport", pp. 387-388.
In Twentieth Century Music v. Aiken, the Court held:
"Creative work is to be encouraged and rewarded, but private motivation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature, music, and the other arts. The immediate effect of our copyright law is to serve a fair return for an "author's" creative labor. But the ultimate aim is, by this incentive, to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good.".
Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken establishes that the goal of limited monopoly privileges granted by the Copyright Act are meant to serve the public good not to benefit the owner of such copyright privileges. The goal of copyright is to encourage artistic creativity for the accessibility of such works to the public and therefore benefit of the public. Copyright is meant to serve as an incentive and encouragement for artists to produce more works. Amanda Webber reiterates: "The 'monopoly privileges' that Congress can authorize through the Copyright Clause are not meant to provide a private benefit to the author. 'The use of this limited monopoly [by the author] . . . is a means of obtaining the goal of copyright: to stimulate artistic creativity for public good.' This public good is achieved when artists are provided with the necessary incentive and encouragement to continue making creative works." Aiken establishes definite favor for the public rather than private domain  in the interpretation of the Copyright Act of 1964 thereby contradicting a previous ruling of the Court in Buck v. Jewell-LaSalle Reality Co., 283 U.S. 191 (1931).
Grounds for overturning a precedent—Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken presents a direct contradiction to the Supreme Court decision in Buck v. Jewell-LaSalle Realty Co., which held that a hotel proprietor who made broadcast music available to his hotel guests did violate the Copyright Act of 1909. Due to this inconsistency, the Supreme Court called upon the legislature to clarify what constitutes a performance and what does not. Both majority and dissenting opinions expressed this sentiments involving the need for clarification by Congress on this issue.
However, instead of addressing the issue raised by Aiken, Congress danced around the issue once again. The amendment they passed made no distinctions.  "But despite this advice, when it came time for the draftsmen actually to resolve the problem, it appears that they decided to avoid it instead. Section 110(5) of the Revision Act, which supposedly deals with the Aiken situation, reads as follows:
 §110. Limitations on exclusive rights: Exemption of certain performances and displays.
 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, the following are not infringements of copyright:
 (5) communication of a transmission embodying a performance or display of a work by the public reception of the transmission on a single receiving apparatus of a kind of commonly used in private homes, unless—
(A) a direct charge is made to see or hear the transmission; or
(B) the transmission thus received is transmitted to the public.
When they asked whether this section would change the result in Aiken, reporters received different answers from the counsel for the Senate Subcommittee, the counsel for the House Subcommittee, and the Registrar of Copyrights, all certainly distinguished authorities on the subject."

From "Twining v. New Jersey" ==> """
Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78 (1908), was a case of the U.S. Supreme Court. In this case, the Court established the Incorporation Doctrine by concluding that while certain rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights might apply to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the Fifth Amendment's right against self-incrimination is not incorporated.
The Twining decision was overturned by the decision in Malloy v. Hogan in 1964, in which the Court incorporated the right against self-incrimination.
Background
The case involved two men charged with fraud in New Jersey who claimed Fifth Amendment protection and refused to testify during their trial. The jury was told of the men's refusal to testify, and they were convicted. They appealed, arguing that the instructions to the jury violated their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
Majority decision
The Supreme Court used the case to decide whether the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was valid during trials in state courts, not just in federal courts. Before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Bill of Rights, including the Fifth Amendment, did not apply to state courts.  The Court did not reach the question of whether the defendants' Fifth Amendment rights were actually violated in the original trial.
The majority opinion was delivered by Justice William Henry Moody. Justice John Marshall Harlan was the lone dissenter. Moody considered both the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: "The general question, therefore, is whether such a law violates the Fourteenth Amendment either by abridging the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States or by depriving persons of their life, liberty or property without due process of law."
Privileges or immunities
The court cited the decision in the Slaughter-House Cases that the language in the Fourteenth Amendment ("No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States...") did not curtail state power. The Supreme Court decided 8-1 that the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination applied only to federal court cases.
Selective incorporation
The case provides an early explanation of the doctrine of selective incorporation: only a portion of the Bill of Rights is applied to the states by incorporation, under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause:
The court concluded that exemption from self-incrimination was not necessary for a conception of due process.
Dissent
Justice Harlan was the lone dissenter, writing firstly that the Court should have decided whether the defendants' rights were actually violated before reaching the "question of vast moment, one of such transcendent importance" of whether the Fifth Amendment applied to state courts and if the Fifth Amendment applied to state courts by the Due Process Clause.
Aftermath
Upheld in 1947
The Twining decision was revisited and upheld in Adamson v. California (1947) in which the merits of Twining were of central consideration. Concurring with the majority, Justice Frankfurter wrote:
However, Justice Hugo Black disagreed and attacked Twining for giving too much power to state courts. In his famous dissent to Adamson, he wrote:
Overturned in 1964
Twining was revisited once again and finally overturned in Malloy v. Hogan (1964). In that case, the Court incorporated the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and applied it to state courts.

From "Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh" ==> """
Twitter Inc. v. Taamneh (Docket 21–1496) is a pending case of the Supreme Court of the United States on October 3, 2022. The case considers whether Internet service providers are liable for "aiding and abetting" a designated foreign terrorist organization in an "act of international terrorism", on account of recommending such content posted by users, under Section 2333 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.  Along with Gonzalez v. Google LLC, Taamneh is one of two cases where social media companies are accused of aiding and abetting terrorism in violation of the law. The cases were decided together in a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that Taamneh's case could proceed. The cases challenge the broad liability immunity for hosting and recommending terrorist content that websites have enjoyed.
History
Jordanian citizen Nawras Alassaf died in 2017 during an Islamic State-affiliated attack in Istanbul.
Arguing that the companies failed to control terrorist content on their sites, Alassaf's family sued Twitter, Google and Facebook.
Arguing that the lower court decision improperly expanded the scope of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2333, Twitter appealed, arguing that the case warranted review from SCOTUS.
On appeal, the Ninth Circuit did not consider protections under Section 230 in the case, and affirmed the lower court ruling that stated that Twitter, Google and Facebook could be liable.
Supreme Court
The Supreme Court granted certiorari for the case in October 2022, alongside the related case Gonzalez v. Google LLC. Free speech organizations like  the Center for Democracy and Technology, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, as well as technology industry trade groups like the Computer & Communications Industry Association, and the US Chamber of Commerce filed amicus briefs in support of the petitioner. The Anti-Defamation League, Senator Chuck Grassley, former US national security officials, and retired American military generals filed amicus briefs in support of the respondent.
The Court heard oral arguments in Twitter on February 22, 2023. The questions and debate among the Justices and counsels for the parties focused more on the language of the Anti-Terrorism Act, particularly the language of "knowingly providing substantial assistance" to terrorism organisms, and what role Twitter and other services had in regards. Observers to the Court believed that the Justices were not looking for broad changes to the Anti-Terrorism Act or Section 230 that would upend the Internet.

Writing for a majority of the court, Justice Byron White concluded that trade dress is inherently distinctive under the Lanham Act and that plaintiffs are not required to prove secondary meaning in suits to protect their trademark.Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 776; see also Paul A. Briganti, Renovating Taco Cabana: The Lanham Act's Protection of Product Design After Samara, 38  481, 495 (2002). The Court upheld an award of $3.7 million in damages, and Taco Cabana ultimately acquired all of Two Pesos' assets in 1993 for $22 million.Jamison Dean Newberg, The Same Old Enchilada?

Background
Lanham Act protections for trademarks
The Lanham Act prohibits "the deceptive and misleading use of marks" to protect business owners "against unfair competition."15 U.S.C. § 1127. The Act defines trademarks as "any word, name, symbol, or device or any combination thereof" used by any person "to identify and distinguish his or her goods, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is unknown." A trademark is considered "distinctive and capable of being protected" if it "either (1) is inherently distinctive or (2) has acquired distinctiveness through secondary meaning."Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 769 (citing  § 13, pp. 37–38, and Comment a (Tent. Draft No. 2, Mar. 23, 1990)). However, a claim for trademark infringement requires "proof of the likelihood of confusion."Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 769–70.
Initial lawsuit
In 1978, Taco Cabana, Inc. began operating a chain of Mexican-style fast-food restaurants in San Antonio, Texas.Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 765. Taco Cabana described the decor of their restaurants as "a festive eating atmosphere having interior dining and patio areas decorated with artifacts, bright colors, paintings and murals."Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 765 (internal quotations and citations omitted). The interior of the restaurants featured a "patio capable of being sealed off from the outside patio by overhead garage doors."Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 765 (stating that "[b]right awnings and umbrellas continue the theme") (internal quotations and citations omitted). In December 1985, Two Pesos, Inc. opened a restaurant in Houston, Texas with a trade dress similar to the one used in Taco Cabana's restaurants. Two Pesos' operations expanded rapidly, but the chain never opened a restaurant in San Antonio. However, in 1986, Taco Cabana opened restaurants in Houston and other markets in Texas where Two Pesos operated restaurants. One year later, Taco Cabana sued Two Pesos in federal district court for trade dress infringement under the Lanham Act and for theft of trade secrets under Texas common law.Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 765–66. Both the district court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed that Two Pesos deliberately infringed upon Taco Cabana's trade dress, and Two Pesos appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.Two Pesos, Inc.,  (granting certiorari in part).
Opinion of the Court
thumb|left|upright=1.2|A Taco Cabana location in Dallas, Texas
Writing for the majority of the Court, Justice Byron White held that a distinctive trade dress is generally entitled to protection under the Lanham Act because users of a trade dress "should be able to maintain what competitive position it has and continue to seek wider identification among potential customers."Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 771. Justice White noted that trade dresses, "even if not registered, remain inherently capable of distinguishing the goods of the users of these marks."Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 772. Additionally, a business owner that copies a trade dress "may be seen as falsely claiming that his products may for some reason be thought of as originating from the plaintiff." Justice White also held that the Lanham Act did not include a secondary meaning requirement for trade dress, concluding that "a secondary meaning requirement for a nondescriptive trade dress would hinder improving or maintaining the producer's competitive position."Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 774. Furthermore, he concluded that a secondary meaning requirement would have anticompetitive effects because a competitor could "appropriate the originator's dress in other markets" prior to the establishment of the secondary meaning and "deter the originator from expanding into and competing in these areas."Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 775. Consequently, the Court ordered Two Pesos to pay $3.7 million in damages to Taco Cabana. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a concurring opinion,Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 776 (Scalia, J., concurring). while Justice John Paul Stevens and Justice Clarence Thomas wrote opinions concurring in the judgment.Two Pesos, Inc., 505 U.S. at 776, 785 (Stevens, J. and Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment).
Subsequent developments
In November 1992, Taco Cabana filed another lawsuit against Two Pesos seeking $5 million in damages for not complying with the Supreme Court's ruling and for creating further confusion among customers.  Two months later, Taco Cabana agreed to buy Two Pesos' assets for approximately $22 million. Richard Cervera, president and chief executive officer of Taco Cabana, stated that converting Two Pesos' restaurants to Taco Cabana restaurants would be “aided by the very striking physical resemblance of the two chains.”Jamison Dean Newberg, The Same Old Enchilada? The Supreme Court Simplifies the Protection of Inherently Distinctive Trade Dress in Two Pesos v. Taco Cabana, 13  299, 330 n.27 (1994) (quoting Greg Hassell, A Tex-Mex Merger: Taco Cabana Gets Its Two Pesos' Worth, , Jan. 13, 1993, at Business 1).

From "TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp." ==> """
TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U.S. 443 (1993), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, which upheld the decision of the West Virginia state court awarding $19,000 in compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive damages to the plaintiff. Although multiple justices recognized that the punitive damages were 526 times the compensatory damages, the Court held a "general concern of reasonableness" should guide courts in determining constitutionally acceptable damages under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Background
TXO Production Corp., a subsidiary of USX, approached Alliance Resources Corp. in 1984 following a recommendation to recover oil and gas under the Blevins Tract by their geologists. TXO offered to pay Alliance $20/acre in cash, 22% of oil and gas revenues in royalties, and all development costs for the site, an offer which Alliance accepted on April 2, 1985. Alliance agreed to return this payment if TXO's attorney determined that "title had failed." TXO's attorneys then discovered a 1958 deed awarding coal recovery rights under the Blevins Tract from Tug Fork Land Company to a series of owners, culminating in the Virginia Crews Coal Company. Interviews with all holders of that deed confirmed that only coal rights were awarded, while the grantor reserved rights to oil and gas. TXO first attempted to make the original holder of the deed state that the 1958 deed might have included the oil and gas rights in question by presenting a pre-written affidavit, which he refused to sign. TXO then paid Virginia Crews $6,000 to convey its interest in the site to TXO, without informing Alliance.
Trial court decision
TXO originally filed a complaint against Alliance to remove a cloud on title on the oil and gas rights for the site. When this was decided in Alliance's favor, Alliance filed a counterclaim for slander of title that went before a jury. Alliance argued that TXO knew Alliance had a good title, that TXO had acted in bad faith to renegotiate the agreement, that the amount of royalties TXO had attempted to reduce was substantial, and that TXO had engaged in similar activities elsewhere. The jury awarded Alliance $19,000 in compensatory damages, based on their costs to defend against TXO's original complaint, and $10 million in punitive damages.
Appeals
 West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals 
On appeal, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals upheld the judgment. TXO argued that no cause of action for slander of title existed or had been established, that West Virginia Rules of Evidence had been violated by introducing testimony of lawyers involved in litigation against TXO elsewhere, and that the award of $10 million violated the Due Process Clause, citing Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1. Alliance argued that this constitutional objection had been waived, that TXO's misconduct was particularly egregious, and that the award was not excessive. The Court's decision relied heavily on their previous decision in Garnes v. Fleming Landfill, Inc., which was considered by the U.S. Supreme Court but remanded to the W.V. Supreme Court of Appeals after the Haslip decision. In this decision, they set forth seven standards for future determination of punitive damages: the relation between the punitive and actual damages, the reprehensibility and time involvement of the defendant's conduct, any potential profit the defendant earned from their conduct, the amount of compensatory damages, the wealth of the defendant, the costs of litigation, and any other civil or criminal sanctions already imposed for the same conduct.
The Court stated that "The type of fraudulent action intentionally undertaken by TXO in this case could potentially cause millions of dollars in damages to other victims. As for the reprehensibility of TXO's conduct, we can say no more than we have already said, and we believe the jury's verdict says more than we could say in an opinion twice this length. Just as important, an award of this magnitude is necessary to discourage TXO from continuing its pattern and practice of fraud, trickery and deceit." Further, the Court stated that because TXO was not a "really stupid" negligent defendant, but a "really mean" intentional wrongdoer, they got what they deserved. This statement was widely criticized by commentators.
 Supreme Court 
 Plurality 
The Supreme Court of the United States then granted certiorari and, in the 1993 decision, upheld the Court of Appeals' judgment. Both parties attempted to establish a test for punitive damages, with TXO favoring a "heightened scrutiny" standard and Alliance favoring a "rational basis" standard. The Court was not persuaded by either argument, with Justice Stevens' decision reiterating a statement made in the Haslip decision: "We need not, and indeed we cannot, draw a mathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and the constitutionally unacceptable that would fit every case. We can say, however, that [a] general concer[n] of reasonableness . . . properly enter[s] into the constitutional calculus." 499 U. S., at 18. Referring to Haslip once again, Stevens said that "it is with this concern for reasonableness in mind that we turn to petitioner's argument that the punitive award in this case was so "grossly excessive" as to violate the substantive component of the Due Process Clause." The plurality determined that the only relevant constitutional question was whether the award was accomplished with procedural fairness. In upholding the original ruling, the plurality determined that the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals was correct in its application of the Garnes case to determine the "reasonableness" of the award.
 Concurrence 
Justice Kennedy's concurrence agreed that the West Virginia courts had followed due process requirements. However, he argued that the alternative "reasonableness" standard proposed by the plurality was flawed, as determining whether an award is "grossly excessive" requires some basis for determination. Without a baseline to compare against, the proposed standard would not impose any practical limits on jury excess. Thus, he suggested that the inquiries for future appeals should focus on whether the jury was motivated by "bias, passion, or prejudice" rather than a concern for deterrence and retribution, disregarding the size of the award. If a rational jury provided the same information that was presented at trial could reasonably reach the same verdict and punitive damages award, Kennedy would uphold it against a substantive due process argument.
Justice Scalia concurred separately, joined by Justice Thomas, disagreeing with the plurality's reasoning on substantive due process. Unlike Kennedy, he believed that the size of an award cannot raise a substantive due process argument. As constitutional literalists, they did not find a substantive right to not be subjected to excessive fines in the 5th or 14th Amendments. Scalia noted that the Haslip decision had indicated that a 4 to 1 ratio between punitive and compensatory damages was close to the line, and that the 526-to-1 ratio in TXO would - if applied consistently - dispose of the vast majority of due process challenges to punitive damages. Indeed, after the Haslip decision, lower courts throughout the country had attempted to adhere to the 4-to-1 ratio rule implied by it.
 Dissent 
Justice O'Connor, joined by Justices White and Souter, dissented from the plurality, calling the "no-mathematical-bright-line" decision a "cop-out" and quoting Justice Potter Stewart's famous statement "I know it when I see it" for comparison. She had been the lone dissenter in the Haslip case, and argued that the guidance to the jury and the post-trial review were both less sufficient in TXO than they had been in Haslip. Like Kennedy, O'Connor was concerned that a jury with the power to issue such large awards could be influenced by bias, passion, or prejudice, especially when not given proper instructions. She also called for a comparison of this award to others upheld against other defendants in West Virginia, and to other similar torts in all jurisdictions. She found that the punitive damages award in TXO was twenty times greater than the largest amount ever handed out in West Virginia, ten times larger than the largest award for slander of title in any jurisdiction, and several times larger than the combined civil and criminal penalties for similar offenses. Further, she pointed out that the amount TXO stood to gain from their fraudulent actions was not mentioned to the jury, calling it "an after-the-fact rationalization invented by counsel to defend this startling award on appeal." She also criticized the majority for not providing any guidance to lower courts, and instead focusing on the specifics of the TXO case. Finally, she pointed out that the three largest awards ever upheld in West Virginia were against out-of-state defendants like TXO.
Effects
As demonstrated by the divided opinions (a 3-justice plurality opinion joined in part by Kennedy, two separate concurrences, and a 3-justice dissent), TXO did not provide a tidy solution to any of the issues that were involved. Six justices agreed that TXO's behavior justified the significant fine, but a different set of 6 justices also found that the current standard for determining appropriate punitive damages is flawed, in one way or another.
The TXO decision was cited by mass media in claims that Americans are overly litigious and intensified calls for legislative tort reform in America. The American Tort Reform Association, which filed an amicus brief on behalf of TXO, claimed that punitive damage awards have grown too large in both size and frequency. Other groups representing American business and medicine claimed that such awards are unfair and adversely impact their international competitiveness, while consumer groups and plaintiffs' attorneys argue that these large awards are necessary for consumer and public protection.
The decision was also cited in claims that judicial regulation of punitive damages is inconsistent and should be replaced by national legislation. Although the TXO case involves a single large award, it has been cited by a number of lower courts in rejecting Due Process Clause arguments against multiple punitive damage awards, e.g. asbestos injury claims, even if the total amount awarded exceeds the defendant's ability to pay. Just a year later, the Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants case and its surrounding publicity amplified those calls for tort reform.

From "Tyler v. Cain" ==> """
Tyler v. Cain, 533 U.S. 656 (2001) is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the rule established under Cage v. Louisiana (1990), where the Court held certain jury instructions unconstitutional because the words used did not suggest the degree of proof required by the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard, was not "made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court." Tyler is the primary case regarding the retroactivity of new rules to successive habeas petitions. 
 Background 
In March 1975, Melvin Tyler got into an argument with his estranged girlfriend. Tyler went to her house and fired shots from a pistol into one of her windows; the bullets ricocheted and killed their 20-year-old daughter. A jury found him guilty and he was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Tyler appealed but the Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed his conviction. By 1986, Tyler filed five state petitions for habeas corpus (post-conviction) relief, which were all denied. Tyler also filed a federal petition for post-conviction relief, which the federal district court denied; this denial was affirmed on appeal.
In 1990, the Supreme Court held in Cage v. Louisiana that certain jury instructions violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because the words "substantial" and "grave" did not suggest the degree of proof required by the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard. Thereafter Tyler filed a sixth state post-conviction relief petition, arguing that the rule in Cage should apply retroactively because the jury instructions in his case were similar to those found unconstitutional in Cage. The state trial court denied the petition, and the Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed. 
In 1997, Tyler filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for permission to file a second post-conviction relief petition. It is required that a prisoner seeking to file a second petition for post-conviction relief must first obtain an order from the court of appeals authorizing the district court to consider the petition. The Fifth Circuit granted Tyler's motion, finding that Tyler made the requisite prima facie ("at first sight") showing that the claim relied on a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive on collateral review by the United States Supreme Court. 
Tyler then filed a second habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The district court ruled that Cage applies retroactively on collateral review, but that Tyler was not entitled to collateral relief based on the merits of his case. The Fifth Circuit affirmed on different grounds, denying Tyler's petition because he "could not show that any Supreme Court decision render[ed] the Cage decision retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review."
 Supreme Court 
 Majority opinion 
The Supreme Court granted certiorari because of conflicts among circuit courts as to whether the new constitutional rule in Cage v. Louisiana applies retroactively on collateral review. In a 5-4 opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit's denial of Tyler's habeas petition.
The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) lays out the process for which prisoners may seek post-conviction relief in federal court. The gatekeeper provision of section 2244(b) requires that a claim from a first petition that is presented in a second petition must be dismissed; the same applies for claims not presented in the first petition, unless the petitioner can show that the new claim “relies on a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court that was previously unavailable.” 
The Court looked to the construction of the gatekeeper provision, interpreting the word "made" to mean "held", and held that a new constitutional rules only applies retroactively on collateral review if the Supreme Court holds that it does. Because no holding of the Court made the rule retroactive, the Court said that the Cage rule could not be applied retroactively on collateral review, and that Tyler's petition was barred under section 2244(b)(2)(A). Justice Thomas explained: "The only holding in Cage is that the particular jury instruction violated the Due Process Clause."
 Concurring opinion 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote a concurring opinion that explained the multiple ways that the Court could hold that a new constitutional rule applies retroactively on collateral review: by explicitly holding so, or by multiple holdings that “logically dictate the retroactivity of the new rule." This "multiple holdings" analysis is more generous than and in tension with the suggestion by the majority that the Supreme Court must always hold a new constitutional rule as retroactively applicable. Courts have adopted Justice O'Connor's "multiple holdings" analysis to determine whether rules apply retroactively.
 Dissent 
Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, filed a dissenting opinion. The dissent argued that the new constitutional rule in Cage has been held to apply retroactively on collateral review, and that Tyler's habeas petition should be allowed. Justice Breyer outlined the possible negative consequences of the majority's decision: "After today's opinion, the only way in which this Court can make a rule such as Cage's retroactive is to repeat its Sullivan reasoning in a case triggered by a prisoner's filing a first habeas petition (a "second or successive" petition itself being barred by the provision here at issue) or in some other case that presents the issue in a posture that allows such language to have the status of a "holding." Then, after the Court takes the case and says that it meant what it previously said, prisoners could file "second or successive" petitions to take advantage of the now-clearly-made-applicable new rule. We will be required to restate the obvious, case by case, even when we have explicitly said, but not "held," that a new rule is retroactive."
 Effects of decision 
The decision in Tyler has been criticized as a narrow interpretation that limits successive habeas petitions. The Court's holding in Tyler narrowed federal habeas review because before Tyler, an inmate could have argued a new constitutional rule from the Supreme Court applies retroactively if the rule fell under one of the two exceptions established in Teague v. Lane (1989), and reviewing courts had more discretion to rule on the merits of such petitions. The two exceptions established in Teague include "watershed" (crucial) rules of criminal procedure and "substantive" rules “that narrow the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting  its terms” or involve “constitutional determinations that place particular conduct or persons covered by the statute beyond the State’s power to punish.” In Tyler, the Court suggested that even if a new rule fell under one of the exceptions in Teague, the new rule does not apply retroactively unless the Court explicitly says so.

From "Tyler v. Hennepin County" ==> """
Tyler v. Hennepin County (Docket 22-166) is a pending United States Supreme Court case about government seizure of property for unpaid taxes, when the value of the property seized is greater than the tax debt. The court will decide whether such a forfeiture violates the Fifth Amendment's protection against taking property without just compensation. The court will also decide whether it is an unconstitutional fine under the Eighth Amendment.
Geraldine Tyler owed $15,000 in property taxes and other associated costs. Hennepin County, Minnesota foreclosed on her condominium, sold it for $40,000, and kept all of the money.
Tyler sued the county, arguing that the $25,000 surplus home equity value was property that the county took away from her in violation of the Fifth Amendment and Eighth Amendment. The district court dismissed the case, ruling in favor of the county on all of Tyler's claims, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. Tyler petitioned to the Supreme Court, which agreed to review the case.
Christina Martin, an attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation, represented Tyler as well as Kevin Fair, who had a similar case before the Supreme Court.

From "Tyler v. Tuel" ==> """
Tyler v. Tuel, 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 324 (1810), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that an assignee of a geographically limited patent right could not bring an action in the assignee's own name.  It was the first published Supreme Court decision on patent law.Robert A. Matthews, Jr., 5 Annotated Patent Digest § 35:1, via Westlaw, retrieved 2014-12-30 ("perhaps the first published decision on a patent question by the Supreme Court").Malla Pollack, The Owned Public Domain: The Constitutional Right Not to Be Excluded - or the Supreme Court Chose the Right Breakfast Cereal in Kellogg v. National Biscuit Co., 22 Hastings Comm. & Ent L.J. 265, 291 n119 (2000).  Like other Supreme Court patent cases prior to Evans v. Eaton, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 454 (1818), however, it did not deal with substantive patent law, but only with the law of patent assignment.Harold C. Wegner, Post-Merck Experimental Use and the "Safe Harbor", 15 Fed. Circuit B.J. 1, 37 (2005).
Background
thumb|Remains of a "wry fly" wheel according to Tyler's invention.
On February 20, 1800, the West Claremont,New Hampshire inventor Benjamin Tyler obtained a patent on a new type of tub wheel, or horizontal water wheel, that he termed the "wry fly."  Tyler later became better known for his second patent on this basic concept, issued in 1804.  Due to the later Patent Office fire, official records of these patents no longer survive. However, the invention was highly influential and anticipated many features of later turbines.
Tyler assigned his right and interest in the 1800 patent to others for $6,000, but reserved to himself the right of use and sale within Chittenden, Addison, Rutland, and Windham counties in Vermont.
Tyler's assignees brought suit against the defendant Tuel in the District of Vermont for infringing the 1800 patent.  They won at trial, but after the verdict was issued, Tuel filed a motion in arrest of judgment, arguing that the assignees never had legal standing to bring the suit, because they were not the assignees of the entire original right and interest in the patent. The district judges were divided on whether to grant the motion or not, and therefore the question went to the Supreme Court on a certificate of division.
Opinion of the Court
As was common in the patent jurisprudence of the time, the court applied principles of property law to the issue.Adam Mossoff, A Simple Conveyance Rule for Complex Innovation, 44 Tulsa L. Rev. 707, 711-12 (2009).  Under section 4 of the Patent Act of 1793,1 Stat. 318, 322. an assignee could bring suit against an infringer but a licensee could not.John F. Duffy, The Festo Decision and the Return of the Supreme Court to the Bar of Patents, 2002 Sup. Ct. Rev. 273, 288 n.51 (2002).  Under the common law, an "assignment" only existed if the entire right and interest was assigned.
The court's certified opinion therefore consisted of one sentence: 
It is the opinion of the Court that the plaintiffs, by their own showing, are not legal assignees to maintain this action in their own names, and that the judgment of the circuit court be arrested.10 U.S. 324, 327.
Subsequent developments
Tyler has been cited in fewer than a dozen cases since it was written. The Tyler rule was abrogated by the Patent Act of 1836.6 Moy's Walker on Patents § 18:33 (4th ed.).  In consequence, Tyler has seldom been cited since the 1830s, except in historical reviews.  In 1868, the Supreme Court noted Tyler&apos;s obsolescence in Moore v. Marsh, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 515 (1868).
The 1836 act, however, only affected geographically divided interests. The Supreme Court therefore continued throughout the 19th century to hold that an assignment that was divided in any non-geographical way was a license rather than an assignment and did not confer standing.Roger D. Blair; Thomas F. Cotter (FNd1), The Elusive Logic of Standing Doctrine in Intellectual Property Law, 74 Tul. L. Rev. 1323, 1337-38 (2000).
Under the Tyler rule, an assignee of a geographical part interest could not bring suit in the assignee's own name.  Justice Story clarified the Tyler rule in a district court opinion in Whittemore v. Cutter, ruling that Tyler did not apply to the transferee of an undivided part interest.Whittemore v. Cutter, 29 F. Cas. 1120, 1120-21 (C.C.D. Mass. 1813).

From "Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo" ==> """
Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, 577 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court affirmed the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which held that representative evidence could be used to support the claims of the class., 136 S. Ct. 1036, 1044-45 (2016). The case arose as a class action lawsuit against Tyson Foods. The Supreme Court affirmed the Eighth Circuit's judgment that the class satisfied the predominance requirement of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure's Rule 23 and that the use of representative evidence was allowable in this case. It has been cited by lower courts and has spawned significant academic discussion.
Background
Employees brought suit in federal district court against Tyson Foods for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the Iowa Wage Payment Collection Law.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1042. The employees worked in an Iowa pork processing plant in the cut and retrim and kill departments. As part of their work, the employees needed to wear protective gear, and the FLSA required for them to be compensated for time spent doing things "integral and indispensable" to their work. The employees claimed that the time spent putting on and taking off their protective gear, "donning and doffing," met the standard and that Tyson Foods should have been paying them for the time that they did so. Instead, Tyson Foods compensated some employees for four to eight minutes of that activity and others for none at all.
The employees sought to certify their class under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Tyson Foods argued that the class should not be certified because of the individual variance in the employees' protective gear.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1042-43. 
The district court held that there were sufficiently-common questions to certify the class, such as whether the donning and doffing qualified as work under the FLSA. Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1043. The case was tried and went to a jury, which had to decide whether the donning and doffing qualified as work and how much time that took but was not paid for by Tyson Foods. The claims were based on overtime work and so only employees who, after including donning and doffing time, worked more than forty hours per week would be able to recover.
However, Tyson Foods did not keep records of the time that employees spent to put on and take off their protective gear. The employees, therefore, relied on their statements, videos of people putting on and taking off protective gear, and a research study. The study had people put on and take off gear and averaged how long it took, which was considered "representative evidence."Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1043-44.
Tyson Foods asked the judge to bifurcate proceedings so that the jury would first answer whether the FLSA covered time taken to put on and take off protective gear and how long the donning and doffing took, and the jury would then determine which employees would be eligible to recover.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1044.
However, Tyson Foods did not question the representative evidence used, such as by moving for a Daubert hearing, and instead emphasized that there was too much individual variance for the issues to be resolved in a class.
The representative evidence presented would have supported an award of $6.7 million. The jury found that donning and doffing was compensable under the FLSA but awarded only $2.9 million to the class.
Tyson moved to set aside the jury verdict by alleging improper class certification. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit disagreed, affirmed the judgment, and held that the use of representative evidence was appropriate in this case.
Decision
The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Eighth Circuit.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1045. The parties were in dispute over whether the class met the predominance inquiry required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3),Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1045-46. which requires the district court to ask whether common questions predominate over individual ones.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1046. That examination is meant to ensure that it makes sense to adjudicate the claims as a class. The predominance inquiry is different from the commonality inquiry in class actions since it asks not only whether there are common questions but also whether the common, class-wide issues are more important or arise more frequently than the individual ones.
Tyson Foods maintained that the common questions did not predominate because it was the questions of each individual's work time that predominated. The employees, by contrast, argued that the representative evidence could replace individual inquiries. The permissibility of the representative evidence, therefore, was central to the case.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1046-47.
The Supreme Court looked to the practical need for representative evidence and recognized that in some cases, it is the only evidence available.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1047. Since Tyson Foods had failed to keep records on employee time, representative evidence was necessary. The key inquiry, according to the Supreme Court, was whether the employees would have similarly used the representative evidence in individual lawsuits if they had brought individual suits instead of a class action.
It was on that point that the Court distinguished Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338 (2011). In Wal-Mart, the class had failed to meet the more basic commonality requirement of class actions.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1048. The plaintiffs wanted to use representative evidence to show that there was a common policy of discretion in employment. However, in that case, since the employees were not similarly situated, they would not have been able to use the representative evidence even if they had brought individual lawsuits.
In Tyson Foods, however, the representative evidence could be used to support a finding for individual plaintiffs. The Court noted that Tyson Foods did not challenge the expert testimony or the study on which the plaintiffs relied.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1049. Also, Tyson Foods argued that because not all class members would be found to be injured and receive compensation, the employees had to show a clear mechanism by which the district court could identify the class members who were not injured and so should not recover.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1049-50. That question was not presented in the lower courts, and the record was not developed on that point, however, so the Supreme Court remanded for further proceedings on that matter.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1050.
Concurrence
Chief Justice Roberts concurred, joined by Justice Alito in Part II.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1050 (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part). Part I suggested that the Court was not relaxing rules for representative evidence in this case but had found that the study met the required standard of proof.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1051 (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part). Part II expressed concern that there is no clear way to determine how much time the jury thought should be compensated for donning and doffing since it awarded a sum lower than the study suggested to ve appropriate. To be compensated, each employee must have gone uncompensated for some of the donning and doffing time and must have worked overtime once that time was factored in.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1051-52 (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part). However, since the jury did not report how much time they found should be compensated for the different departments, it is unclear how the district court would be able to award damages only to employees who were found by the jury found to be injured.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1052-53 (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part).
Dissent
Justice Thomas dissented, joined by Justice Alito.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1053 (Thomas, J., dissenting). The dissent believed the district court was wrong in finding that the class satisfied Rule 23's predominance requirement because it did not recognize that whether each employee worked overtime was a critical individual issue.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1054 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Because the district court did not appropriately analyze the class certification requirements, according to the dissent, Tyson Foods could be held liable to a large group without proof that each individual within the class was injured. The dissent suggested that the majority also opinion improperly construed the predominance inquiry, relaxed the rule for representative evidence, and failed to adhere to prior precedent.Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1056 (Thomas, J., dissenting).

From "U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton" ==> """
U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 779 (1995), is a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in which the Court ruled that states cannot impose qualifications for prospective members of the U.S. Congress stricter than those the Constitution specifies. The decision invalidated 23 states' Congressional term limit provisions. The parties to the case were U.S. Term Limits, a nonprofit advocacy group, and Arkansas politician Ray Thornton, among others.. 
Background
Constitutional amendment 73 to the Arkansas Constitution denied ballot access to any federal Congressional candidate having already served three terms in the U.S. House or two terms in the U.S. Senate. (Such a candidate was not barred from being written in and winning by that method.)
Soon after the amendment's adoption by ballot measure at the general election on November 3, 1992, Bobbie Hill, a member of the League of Women Voters, sued in state court to have it invalidated. She alleged that the amendment amounted to an unwarranted expansion of the qualifications for membership in Congress enumerated in the U.S. Constitution:
and:
Also critical to the issue is the 17th Amendment, which transferred power to select U.S. senators from the state legislature, to the people of the state:
U.S. Term Limits claimed that Amendment 73 was "a permissible exercise of state power under the Elections Clause".
Both the trial court and the Arkansas Supreme Court agreed with Hill, declaring Amendment 73 unconstitutional.U.S. Term Limits v. Hill, 316 Ark. 251, 263, 872 S.W.2d 349, 355 (1994), aff'd sub nom. U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 779 (1995).
Supreme Court decision
The Supreme Court affirmed by a 5–4 vote. The majority and minority articulated different views of the character of the federal structure established in the Constitution. Writing for the majority, Justice John Paul Stevens concluded:
He further ruled that sustaining Amendment 73 would result in "a patchwork of state qualifications" for U.S. representatives, and called that consequence inconsistent with "the uniformity and national character that the framers sought to ensure." Concurring, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that the amendment interfered with the "relationship between the people of the Nation and their National Government."
Justice Clarence Thomas, in dissent, countered:
He also noted that the amendment did not actually prevent anyone from election since it only prevents prospective fourth-termers from being printed on the ballot, not from being written in, and therefore did not overstep the qualifications clause of the federal Constitution.

From "Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers" ==> """
Union Pacific Railroad v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 558 U.S. 67 (2009), was a United States Supreme Court decision on labor disputes.
Background
The Railway Labor Act was created to enable peaceful resolution of labor disputes between Railroad Companies and their Unions. For disputes deemed minor a panel of five would meet; two from the railroad industry, two from the unions and one neutral party under the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). In order to reach arbitration the two parties had to exhaust their grievance procedures under their own Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBA). If this fails then either party may refer the issue to the NLRB with full statements of facts that these negotiations took place.
Union Pacific Railroad Company issued disciplinary violations against five of its employees represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), a division of the Teamsters. The union then initiated grievance proceedings under their CBA. Dissatisfied with the outcome, the Union appealed to the NLRB Board. In opening proceedings one of the industry representatives objected that there was no evidence in the filing that the two parties had conferenced under their CBA.
The NLRB dismissed their petition for lack of required evidence. It also denied the BLET the right to add proof of conferencing to the complaint because as an appellate body it is not permitted to receive new evidence.
The District Court for the Northern District of Illinois affirmed the decision of the NLRB where it was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The Appellate Court decided that the singular question at issue was whether written documentation of CBA arbitration was a required perquisite to NLRB arbitration. The court determined there was no such requirement in any rules or regulations of the NLRB and had acted outside the will and intent of the Congress. However the Seventh Circuit did not invoke only statutory grounds for rejection of the NLRB but ruled that the NLRB proceedings had violated the Union's due process.
Decision of the Court
The Court ruled unanimously with Justice Ginsburg writing the opinion. The Court agreed with the outcome of the Seventh Circuit but not its reasoning. Ginsburg wrote that the Appeals Court had incorrectly applied a constitutional remedy instead of purely a statutory one, the court affirmed the Seventh Circuit ruling on statutory grounds and ruling that the NLRB had not denied due process but had merely "failed to conform or confine itself to the jurisdiction Congress gave it."

From "Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Botsford" ==> """
Union Pacific Railway Company v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250 (1891), was a case before the United States Supreme Court.
Background
A railroad passenger, Clara L. Botsford, sustained permanent injuries to her brain and spinal cord when a berth from a sleeping car fell upon her head.  She sued the railroad for negligence in the construction of the railroad car which allegedly caused her injuries. The Union Pacific Railway Company claimed that it was entitled, without her consent, to an opportunity to surgically examine her to determine her diagnosis and the extent of her injuries.
Decision
The court disagreed, holding that there was no authority under the common law or statutory law for the trial court to order such an examination: "No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law.".

From "Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Cheyenne" ==> """
Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Cheyenne, 113 U.S. 516 (1885), was an appeal from the Supreme Court of the Territory of Wyoming regarding a bill charging that the collection of an illegal tax would involve the plaintiff in a multiplicity of suits as to the title of lots being laid out and sold, which would prevent their sale, and which would cloud the title to all his real estate, states a case for relief in equity..
Background
An Act of the Legislature of Wyoming, passed December 13, 1879, required the state auditor to furnish to the territorial board of equalization a list for assessment and taxation of the roadbed, superstructure, and other enumerated property of every railroad and telegraph company in the territory when any portion of the property of such company was situated in more than one county, and required the board to value and assess the property of the corporation for each mile of its road or line, and to certify to the county clerks of the counties in which the property was situated the assessment per mile, specifying the number of miles and amount in each of the counties, and which required the county commissioners to decide and adjust the number of miles and amounts within each precinct, township, or school district within their respective counties and cause such amounts to be entered on the lists of taxable property returned by the assessors, withdrew the duty of assessing fractional parts of such railroad and the property of such companies from all local assessors in the territory, including its incorporated cities.
A statute which provides a general scheme for assessing and taxing the property of railroad and telegraph companies as a whole and for distributing it ratably among the different counties and their several precincts, townships and districts according to the number of miles of line in each repeals, as to such property, a power conferred upon the authorities of a city to make provisions for the assessment of the taxes which they were authorized by other provisions of the city charter to assess and collect.
The bill in this case was filed by the Union Pacific Railway Company against the City of Cheyenne and its marshal, Ryan, to enjoin the collection of certain city taxes for the year 1880, which the railway company alleges were unlawfully assessed against it. The bill was demurred to by the defendants, and the District Court for the First Judicial District of Wyoming, in which the suit was brought, overruled the demurrer, and granted the injunction prayed for. The defendants adhered to their demurrer and appealed to the supreme court of the territory, and the decree of the district court was reversed and the bill ordered to be dismissed, and the case is now brought here by appeal.
Question on certiorari
The main question raised by the bill is whether the Union Pacific Railroad, which passes through the whole length of Wyoming Territory, and in its course passes through the City of Cheyenne, with its accompanying telegraph, appurtenances, and rolling stock, is liable to be assessed and valued for the purposes of taxation in Cheyenne by the city authorities, or only by the territorial board of equalization.
Opinion of the Court
The high court found that the allegations of the bill in this case bring it fairly within the jurisdiction of the court. It showed that it would involve the plaintiff in a multiplicity of suits as to title of lots laid out and being sold; would prevent their sale, and would cloud the title to all its real estate. We think that these results are sufficiently apparent, and render it unnecessary to look further. The allegation of fraud has not been proven, and cannot therefore have any effect in the case. It is unnecessary to inquire into the sufficiency of other grounds for equitable relief which are alleged in the bill.
Another point raised by the defendants, not affecting the jurisdiction of the court but the propriety of its taking jurisdiction, is that the complainant ought to have paid the taxes which are conceded to be due to the city for the year 1880. As the court understood the facts stated by the bill (which, of course, the demurrer admits to be true), the complainant did pay to the city all the taxes which would be due upon the assessment and valuation made by the board of equalization, including taxes due on outside property of the company in the city.
The court found that the decree of the Supreme Court of Wyoming should be reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to enter a decree in favor of the complainant in conformity with this opinion, and it was so ordered.

From "United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc." ==> """
United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187 (1991), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States establishing that private sector policies prohibiting women from knowingly working in potentially hazardous occupations are discriminatory and in violation of Title VII and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978.. The case revolved around Johnson Controls' policy of excluding fertile women from working in battery manufacturing jobs because batteries contain high amounts of lead, which entails health risks to people's reproductive systems (both men and women) and fetuses. At the time the case was heard, it was considered one of the most important sex-discrimination cases since the passage of Title VII.
Opinion of the Court
The majority opinion by Justice Blackmun held that that Title VII prohibits gender–specific fetal protection policies. Hence based on that statute,  the Court decided against Johnson Controls by concluding that the company’s fetal protection policy contravened Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the PDA; and the company's gender-specific rule was biased and inequitable because it permitted fertile men, but not fertile women, to decide whether to work in jobs subjected to lead exposure while manufacturing batteries. The court rejected Johnson Controls' argument that their policy fell under the Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ) defense because the protection of employees' fetuses was not an essential part of the business's operation.Bernstein, Andrew Evan (1992).

From "United Building & Construction Trades Council v. Mayor and Council of Camden" ==> """
United Building & Construction Trades Council v. Mayor and Council of Camden, 465 U.S. 208 (1984), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a city can pressure private employers to hire city residents, but the same exercise of power to bias private contractors against out-of-state residents may be called into account under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article Four of the United States Constitution..
Facts and procedural history
A municipal ordinance of the city of Camden, New Jersey, required at least 40% of the employees of contractors and subcontractors working on city construction projects to be Camden residents. In November 1980, the city initiated administrative procedures with the Chief Affirmative Action Officer of the New Jersey Treasury Department to gain state approval for the ordinance as an affirmative action program.  When the Affirmative Action Officer approved the ordinance, the plaintiff trade union filed a notice of appeal with the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance. The New Jersey Supreme Court then certified the appeal onto its own docket, in order to decide all the issues in the case.
The New Jersey Supreme Court held first that the ordinance did not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause because the city was acting as a market participant.United Building & Construction Trades Council v. Mayor and Council of Camden, 88 N.J. 317,  It further held that the Privileges and Immunities Clause did not apply to the ordinance because the discrimination was based on municipal, not state, residency.
Supreme Court
Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, held first that the fact that Camden adopted the discriminatory ordinance in its capacity as a municipality does not render it immune from review under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Secondly, he held that even though the ordinance discriminates against New Jerseyans who are not Camden residents just as much as it discriminates against out-of-state citizens, New Jersey citizens at least have the chance to remedy the problem through the political process (the state legislature). Out-of-state residents have no such option.
Rehnquist also formulated a framework for analysis for Privileges and Immunities claims. First, the Court must decide whether the law in question burdens any of the privileges or immunities protected by the clause.  Rehnquist held that an out-of-state resident's interest in employment on public works contracts was "'fundamental' to the promotion of interstate harmony" and therefore protected by the clause.
Rehnquist distinguished the Privileges and Immunities from the Dormant Commerce Clause by explaining that while the Dormant Commerce Clause is a judicially created doctrine to prevent economic protectionism, the Privileges & Immunities Clause is an actual Constitutional text to protect people’s rights. Thus, since the clauses have two distinct purposes, the “market participant” exception did not apply to the Privileges and Immunities analysis.  Camden could pressure public works contractors to hire city residents without running afoul of the Dormant Commerce Clause, but this did not allow the city to escape scrutiny under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.  However, Rehnquist went on to explain that the Privileges and Immunities Clause did not bar all potentially discriminatory acts by a state or political subdivision.
The city of Camden argued that its ordinance was intended to remedy its urban decay high unemployment, a decline in the city's tax base, and "middle-class flight" from the city. The city argued further that the ordinance was meant to keep a certain number of jobs within the city itself, without unduly harming those potential employees who were non-residents. Rehnquist held that even though Camden's justification of the ordinance was acceptable and that the ordinance was properly tailored to reduce the impact of the discrimination, there were inadequate findings of fact upon which to determine whether the ordinance was constitutional. He remanded the case back to the New Jersey Supreme Court.
Dissenting opinion
Justice Blackmun was the sole dissenter in the case. He rejected Rehnquist's assertion that discrimination based on municipal residence could not escape scrutiny under the Privileges and Immunities Clause because both in-state and out-of-state citizens could be equally harmed by such protectionist legislation. He also wrote that the Clause was never intended by the Framers of the Constitution to reach this type of discrimination by municipalities. Finally, he believed that out-of-state residents could benefit indirectly from the political action of in-state residents' opposition to such discriminatory measures by municipalities because some states (California and Georgia) had already passed laws prohibiting exactly the type of protectionist ordinances as the one in this case.

From "United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Ideal Cement Co." ==> """
United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Ideal Cement Co., 369 U.S. 134 (1962), is a United States Supreme Court case which vacated a lower appellate court decision, holding that federal courts should abstain from ruling on the constitutionality of a state tax issue that state courts should determine..
Background
The United Gas Pipe Line Company operates three interstate natural gas pipelines that connect to a station located in Mobile, Alabama, where the gas is reduced in pressure and is distributed using a system operated by the Mobile Gas Service Corporation. United Gas had contracts to provide gas to two industrial facilities owned by the Ideal Cement Company and the Scott Paper Company, each with clauses that the customer would reimburse United Gas for any taxes it paid for providing gas. The City of Mobile has an ordinance requiring a license to conduct a business for the sale of natural gas within the city involving a payment of 1.5% of gross receipts. United Gas, which is incorporated in Delaware, reimbursed Mobile Gas for the amount it paid to the city for the gas deliveries made to Ideal Cement and Scott Paper, and then filed suit in federal court based upon diversity jurisdiction for recovery of that amount from Ideal Cement and Scott Paper. At issue in the case was whether the city license represented a tax and whether it constituted a precondition to conduct interstate trade in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The federal district court granted summary judgment in favor of United Gas based upon the tax provision of the contracts, but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court based upon the constitutional issue. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.
Opinion
In a per curiam decision, the Supreme Court vacated the opinion of the court of appeals, noting that the Alabama Supreme Court had never provided a construction of the city ordinance. Since the state court was the authoritative forum for interpreting the ordinance and determining whether it was a tax, the Court ruled that adjudication of the federal constitutional issue should wait while the construction of the city ordinance could be sought by the parties in state court.
In a concurring opinion, Justice Douglas indicated that the ordinance was a tax on intrastate activities and he would reverse the court of appeals decision on that basis.
Justice Harlan wrote a dissenting opinion which stated that the interpretation of the city ordinance in state courts would not determine the federal constitutional issue. He stated that he would adjudicate that issue instead now.
Analysis
Although unstated or cited in the Supreme Court opinion, this case involves an application of the Pullman abstention doctrine from Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co. (1941).. That case holds that federal courts should not adjudicate the constitutionality of an ambiguous state statute fairly open to interpretation until courts in that state have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to rule on the proper statutory construction. Pullman abstention applies even when there is no pending state case, which was the situation here in Ideal Cement since there was no active Alabama state court case involving the city ordinance.Pullman, 312 U.S. at 501-02; and 
The provision of natural gas to the Ideal Cement plant was also the subject of a prior Supreme Court case, United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp. (1956).. The issue in that case was whether United Gas could increase the contract rate for natural gas to the cement plant by unilaterally filing a new rate schedule with the Federal Power Commission. The Supreme Court in that case held that the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) did not authorize the abrogation of contracts, so the new rate schedule could not change the rate for the gas for the cement plant. This case, along with Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co. (1956). established the Mobile-Sierra doctrine in U.S. administrative law, which holds that an electricity or natural gas supply rate established resulting from a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be "just and reasonable" and thus acceptable under the NGA or Federal Power Act.

From "United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas, & Water Division" ==> """
United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division, 358 U.S. 103 (1958), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court interpreted the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) as allowing a gas supply company to unilaterally modify a rate in a natural gas supply contract if the contract specified that the rate was that of the rate schedule filed with the Federal Power Commission (FPC) and the gas company filed a new rate schedule.. This case clarified the Mobile-Sierra doctrine established by United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp. (1956). and its companion case Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co. (1956),. which holds that an electricity or natural gas supply rate established resulting from a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be "just and reasonable" and thus acceptable under the NGA or Federal Power Act (FPA).
Background
The NGA was enacted in 1938 to regulate the interstate natural gas industry, including gas pipeline companies. The NGA regulated the rates charged by gas companies to their customers, which included local gas distribution companies and industrial users, through the filing by gas companies of rate schedules and contracts with customers. The NGA required gas companies to file tariffs of their new rates with the FPC, a federal administrative agency, at least thirty days prior to their becoming effective, and authorized the FPC to investigate rates to determine if they were in the public interest. The FPC could also suspend rates except for those involving gas supplied to industrial users while the investigating the rates.
The United Gas Pipe Line Co., a natural gas pipeline company that operated in several states and was subject to regulation under the NGA, provided gas under long-term contracts to distribution companies such as the Texas Gas Transportation Corp., Southern Natural Gas Co., and the Mississippi Valley Gas Co. The Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division (MLGW), a distribution system in Memphis, Tennessee, purchased gas from Texas Gas under a contract in which MLGW was required to reimburse Texas Gas for any increases in the cost of gas provided by United Gas. Each of these contracts had a clause which specified that the rate for the gas was that on the United Gas rate schedule on file with the FPC or any effective rate schedule. On September 30, 1955, United Gas filed a new rate schedule with the FPC which proposed to increase the contract rates. The FPC suspended the rates as provided in the NGA and initiated an administrative proceeding to determine the lawfulness of the new rate schedule. The distribution companies and MLG&W intervened in the proceeding. After the Supreme Court issued its Mobile Gas decision which held that the unilateral filing of a new rate schedule could not abrogate a gas contract with a specified rate on February 27, 1956, the distribution companies and MLGW moved to dismiss the new rate schedule. The FPC upheld the new rate schedule on the basis that the distribution companies had contracted to essentially pay the "going" rate on the effective United Gas rate schedule, and distinguished Mobile Gas as applying to gas contracts with a fixed rate.
The distribution companies and MLGW appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which then reversed the FPC in an opinion which held that Mobile Gas had established that the FPC could review the new rate schedule only if the customers of a gas company consented to the filing of the schedule. The Supreme Court granted certiorari based on a claim that the Court of Appeals misunderstood the Memphis Gas decision.
Opinion
In a majority opinion by Justice Harlan, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals, stating that it "misconceived" the Mobile Gas decision. Mobile Gas involved contracts to supply gas at a specific price, and the NGA did not permit a gas pipeline company to abrogate the contract by filing a new rate schedule. In Memphis, United Gas and the distribution companies had agreed in the contract that the price would be the current "going" rate, which left United Gas able to revise the rate by filing a new rate schedule with the FPC subject only to review for lawfulness under the NGA. The Court explained that in allowing gas companies and customers to determine gas rates through contracts in the NGA, Congress was indicating that the public interest not only required protection of customers from excessive gas costs, but also recognized the legitimate interest of natural gas companies. The opinion stated that natural gas companies, in order to protect their ability to access financial markets, must be able to raise rates in order to fund the maintenance of gas systems and its expansion through debt and securities. This was a proper concern of Congress in enacting the NGA as noted in Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co. (1944).. Lastly, the opinion noted that "going" rate contracts were common, and the ability of gas companies to revise the "going" rate by filing new rate schedules had not previously been considered to be an issue.
Justice Douglas in his dissenting opinion stated that it had been his understanding that Mobile Gas required that rates in gas contracts could only be revised under the NGA with the agreement of the parties, which would include the customers.
In Memphis, the oral argument before the Supreme Court on behalf of the FPC was made by U.S. Solicitor General J. Lee Rankin.
Subsequent events
A motion for rehearing of the decision was denied by the Supreme Court in 1959..
Although the dissenting opinion in Memphis suggested that the decision would "make a shambles" of the administration of the NGA as far as customer interests were concerned, the Supreme Court did not find it necessary to rule on issues involving the Mobile-Sierra doctrine for another fifty years. In Morgan Stanley Capital Group v. Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County, Washington (2008),. the Court held that the restrictions against the modification of contracts also applied to customers with unfavorable rates. One reference describes the Mobile Gas, Sierra Power, and Memphis cases as the first chapter of the Mobile-Sierra doctrine, with Morgan Stanley as the second chapter and NRG Power Marketing, LLC v. Maine Public Utilities Commission (2010). as the third.
On October 1, 1977, the FPC was replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission..

From "United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp." ==> """
United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332 (1956), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court interpreted the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) as not allowing a gas supply company to unilaterally modify rates in a natural gas supply contract by filing a new rate schedule with the Federal Power Commission (FPC).. Mobile Gas and its companion case Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co.. established the Mobile-Sierra presumption which holds that an electricity or natural gas supply rate established resulting from a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be "just and reasonable" and thus acceptable under the NGA or Federal Power Act (FPA).
Background
The NGA was enacted in 1938 to regulate the interstate natural gas industry, including gas pipeline companies. The NGA regulated the rates charged by gas companies to their customers, which included local gas distribution companies and industrial users, through the filing by gas companies of rate schedules and contracts with customers. The NGA required gas companies to file tariffs of their new rates with the FPC, a federal administrative agency, at least thirty days prior to their becoming effective, and authorized the FPC to investigate rates to determine if they were in the public interest. The FPC could also suspend rates except for those involving gas supplied to industrial users while the investigating the rates.
In 1946 the Ideal Cement Company wanted to construct a cement plant in Mobile, Alabama. The local natural gas distribution company, Mobile Gas Service Company, entered into a ten-year contract with the United Gas Pipe Line Company to obtain gas at 10.7 cents per thousand cubic feet, which was at a substantially lower price than that charged for other gas customers, so that it could then provide the gas to the cement plant at 12 cents per thousand cubic feet. The contract between Mobile Gas and United Gas was filed with and approved by the FPC, and became part of the tariff and contracts on file for United Gas.
In June 1953 United Gas filed a new rate schedule with the FPC which purported to increase the rate for the natural gas for resale to the Ideal Cement plant to 14.5 cents per thousand cubic feet, which was a rate closer to that paid by other gas customers. Mobile Gas objected, stating that under the NGA United Gas could not unilaterally change the contract rate. The FPC ruled that the new rate, being a non-suspendable industrial rate under the NGA, would automatically become effective thirty days after it was filed unless it found the rate to be unlawful. Mobile Gas paid the new rate until April 15, 1955, when it assigned its contract with Ideal Cement to United Gas with the approval of the FPC. Since the only remaining issue was the alleged excess payment resulting from the difference between 10.7 and 14.5 cents per thousand cubic feet that Mobil Gas had paid to United Gas while responsible for the contract, the FPC ended its investigation regarding the validity of the new rate as it believed that its ruling would not have a retroactive effect.
Mobile Gas appealed the administrative decision of the FPC to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which reversed the decision and directed the FPC to reject the new tariffed rate in question and to order United Gas to refund the excess payments received under the new rate. The FPC and United Gas appealed the circuit court order to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.
Opinion
The unanimous opinion by Justice Harlan noted that there was no allegation that the NGA was unconstitutional, so the only issue in the case involved the statutory interpretation of the NGA. The opinion stated that the provision in the NGA requiring the filing of rate schedules was not a rate setting procedure, but a prerequisite to the establishment of new rates. While the NGA
required a gas company to file new rates and contracts with the FPC, it did not authorize the abrogation of any contract in effect. The FPC could investigate rates in contracts, but contracts could be modified or rejected by the FPC only if the rate in the contract was found to be so low as to be harmful to third parties and not in the public interest. Thus, a gas company had no authority to unilaterally change a rate in a contract by filing a new rate schedule with the FPC.
The opinion also explained that the NGA was different from the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) then in effect, which required transportation companies to use the same rate schedule for all customers and did not authorize special rates to be set by contract with individual customers as the large number of customers engaged in interstate commerce did not permit an administrative agency to review contracts with special rates. In comparison, there were relatively few gas companies and customers, and the NGA’s authorization to set rates using contracts recognized that dedicated infrastructure and capacity with individualized costs might be required for a gas company to serve a customer. Based on this difference, the Court then distinguished the prior case of Armour Packing Co. v. United States (1908),. where a contract between a shipper and a railroad used the same rate as in a rate schedule filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The railroad later filed a new rate schedule with the ICC. The Supreme Court held in that case that the new rate applied as the ICA, unlike the NGA, required the same rate schedule for all customers.
As the NGA did not authorize a gas company to change rates specified in its contracts unilaterally, the new rate schedule filed by United Gas was a nullity with respect to the gas provided for the Ideal Cement plant. As such, United Gas was required to refund the excess payments made under the new rate schedule to Mobile Gas.
Subsequent events
The Supreme Court in the companion case FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co. found a similar result regarding contracts filed with the FPC involving electricity sales under the FPA. In later cases, the validity of rates set by contracts between gas and electric transmission companies became known as the Mobile-Sierra presumption. Under this presumption, an electricity or gas rate specified in a freely negotiated contract is presumed to be “just and reasonable” and thus acceptable under the FPA or NGA.
A later case which had facts similar to Mobile Gas, except that the contract between the gas pipeline company and customer stated that the applicable rate was the rate in the schedule filed with the FPC. In United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division (1958),. the Supreme Court held that the gas company could revise the referenced gas rate in the contract by filing a new rate schedule with the FPC.
The cost of natural gas supplied by United Gas to the cement plant in Mobile, Alabama was the subject of a later Supreme Court decision, United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Ideal Cement Co. (1962).. The issue in that case was whether United Gas could recoup the cost of a tax levied by the City of Mobile on natural gas sales. The Supreme Court vacated a lower court ruling that the tax was actually a means of licensing a pipeline company’s right to enter the state, and stated that federal courts should abstain from ruling on complex state law issues which have not yet been resolved. This form of federal court abstention is based on the case of Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co. (1941). and is known as the Pullman abstention doctrine.
On October 1, 1977, the FPC was replaced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission..

From "United Haulers Ass'n v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority" ==> """
United Haulers Ass'n v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, 550 U.S. 330 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case about interstate commerce.  Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion of the Court, holding that New York county ordinances forcing private waste management companies to deliver waste to a public facility did not discriminate against interstate commerce.  Justice Samuel Alito wrote a dissent.
 Background 
The plaintiff, United Haulers, a not-for-profit corporation made up of waste management companies, sued the New York counties of Oneida and Herkimer, which controlled the Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  United Haulers claimed that county ordinances requiring all solid wastes and recyclables generated within the two counties to be delivered to one of several waste processing facilities owned by the Authority violated the Dormant Commerce Clause.
Procedural history
The district court ruled in favor of United Haulers, on the basis of the Supreme Court's holding in C&A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, New York.  The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that the public benefit outweighed any restriction on interstate commerce.  United Haulers appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.
Decision
Issue
Does an ordinance requiring delivery of all solid waste to a publicly owned and operated local facility impose a substantial burden on interstate commerce and therefore violate the Commerce Clause?
Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the Court, held that the law did not violate the dormant commerce clause.  
In Carbone v. Clarkstown,511 U. S. 383 (1994) the Court struck down a similar flow control ordinance that forced haulers to deliver waste to a private processing facility.  Here, the Court held that because the facilities were owned and operated by a state-created public benefit corporation, the restriction was permissible.  "Disposing of trash," Roberts wrote, "has been a traditional government activity for years, and laws that favor the government in such areas— but treat every private business, whether in-state or out-of-state, exactly the same—do not discriminate against interstate commerce for purposes of the Commerce Clause."  Roberts applied the balancing test from Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.397 U. S. 137 (1970) to determine that the local benefits outweigh the interstate commerce concerns, but a majority of the court did not agree that applying the balancing test was necessary.
Scalia's concurrence
Justice Scalia agreed with the Court's holding, and wrote separately to restate his opinion that "the so-called 'negative' Commerce Clause is an unjustified judicial invention, not to be expanded beyond its existing domain."  Scalia also objected to the use of the Pike test.
Thomas's concurrence
Justice Thomas agreed with the Court's holding, and wrote separately to refute the majority opinion he had joined in C&A Carbone, Inc. v. Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383 (1994) stating that, contrary to his position in Carbone, he now believes "the negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the Constitution and has proved unworkable in practice."
Dissent
Justice Alito, joined by Justices Stevens and Kennedy, dissented from the Court's holding, stating that the facts in this case did not differ enough from those in Carbone to justify the opposite result.

From "United Mine Workers of America v. Bagwell" ==> """
United Mine Workers of America v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821 (1994), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court laid out the constitutional limitations for the use of contempt powers by courts..
Facts
A trial court enjoined striking unions in Virginia from undertaking certain unlawful activities (throwing things, threatening, obstructing, and picketing without supervision); when union members repeatedly violated the injunction, the trial court established a schedule of $100,000 fine for future violent breaches, $20,000 fine for future non-violent breaches; after more violations of the injunction, the trial court ended up assessing $64 million, including $12 million to the plaintiff in the civil case and $52 million to the county and the commonwealth of Virginia. The parties settled, but the trial court refused to vacate the fines to be paid to the county and commonwealth. The Virginia appellate court reversed the trial court, but the Virginia Supreme Court reversed the appellate court. Appeal was then taken to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Issue
Were these fines civil, or were they criminal (in which case due process and jury would be required)?
Opinion of the Court
The Court, in an opinion by Justice Blackmun, held that a contempt sanction is civil if it is remedial and for the benefit of the complainant—if it either coerces the defendant into compliance with the court’s order or compensates the complainant for losses sustained. But where a fine is not compensatory, it is civil only if the contemnor is afforded an opportunity to "purge" (avoid or reduce fine through compliance); otherwise, it is criminal contempt.
Therefore, there could be no compensation to the plaintiff as there was no opportunity for the defendant to purge the contempt. Therefore, these were criminal fines, which required appropriate due process—a trial by jury—which had not been afforded.
Justice Scalia wrote a concurring opinion, expressing concern about the judge also acting as rulemaker and enforcer. Justice Ginsburg also wrote a concurring opinion, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, further elucidating the distinction between civil and criminal fines.

From "United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs" ==> """
United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that in order for a United States district court to have pendent jurisdiction over a state-law cause of action, state and federal claims must arise from the same "common nucleus of operative fact" and the plaintiff must expect to try them all at once..   This case was decided before the existence of the current supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1367..
Facts and procedural history
This case arose out of a dispute between two labor unions over the representation of coal miners in Marion County, Tennessee.  Plaintiff Paul Gibbs was a truck driver and coal miner who had been hired by the Grundy Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company, to be the superintendent of a coal mine to be opened near Gray's Creek, and to arrange for the coal to be hauled to the nearest railroad depot.  The mine would have been within the jurisdiction of United Mine Workers of America (UMW) Local 5881, whose members had previously worked for Tennessee Consolidated.  Gibbs had planned instead to use members of the rival Southern Labor Union to work the mine.
News of the mine's planned opening reached the UMW members, and on August 15 and 16, 1960, a group of armed miners from Local 5881 arrived at the site to prevent the mine from being opened.  They threatened Gibbs, and beat the Southern Labor Union representative.  UMW field representative George Gilbert was away on business in Middlesboro, Kentucky at the time of the incident, and learned of the violence while he was away.  Gilbert returned to the site, and established a picket line, which lasted for nine months.  There was no further violence at the site, and no further attempts were made by any party to open the mine.
Gibbs lost his job as mine superintendent, and was therefore unable to commence performance of his haulage contract.  He also lost some of his other mine leases and trucking contracts elsewhere in the state.  Believing that his losses were part of a union conspiracy against him, he sued the United Mine Workers (but not the specific local or its members) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  The counts on Gibbs' complaint included allegations that the UMW engaged in a secondary boycott in violation of § 303 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, and that the UMW engaged in tortious interference with his employment relationship and a civil conspiracy in violation of the common law of the state of Tennessee.
The district court judge refused to submit to the jury the claims of pressure intended to cause mining firms other than Grundy to cease doing business with Gibbs, finding these claims unsupported by the evidence. The jury's verdict was that the UMW had violated both § 303 and state law.  Gibbs was awarded $60,000 as damages under the employment contract and $14,500 under the haulage contract; he was also awarded $100,000 punitive damages.  On motion, the trial court set aside the award of damages with respect to the haulage contract on the ground that the damages were unproved.  It also held that union pressure on Grundy to discharge Gibbs as supervisor would constitute only a primary dispute with Grundy, as Gibbs' employer, and hence was not cognizable as a claim under 303.  Interference with the employment relationship was cognizable as a state law claim, however, and a remitted award was sustained on that claim.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision.
Decision
Majority opinion
Justice Brennan first held that Gibbs' state law claims were not preempted by federal law, and then moved on to the central issue in the case:  whether the district court acted properly in exercising jurisdiction over both the state law and federal law claims.  He wrote that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure encouraged the joinder of claims, parties, and remedies to the broadest extent possible, in keeping with the principles of judicial economy and fairness to the parties.  However, he noted that pendent jurisdiction, while it can exist whenever there is a federal question under Article III, § 2 of the Constitution, is a matter of discretion for the district court, not a matter of right for the plaintiff.  Here, Brennan established the test for pendent jurisdiction known as the "common nucleus of operative fact":  the claims must derive from the same situation, such that a plaintiff would ordinarily expect to try them all in one judicial proceeding.
Brennan listed some situations where pendent jurisdiction would be inappropriate.  If the plaintiff's federal law claims are dismissed before trial, the state law claims should be as well; likewise, if the state law claims predominate in the plaintiff's complaint, the district court may dismiss the state law claims without prejudice for a state court to hear.  Also, Brennan explained that in some cases, the likelihood of jury confusion in dealing with separate legal theories of relief could militate in favor of separate trials for the state and federal claims.  Brennan concluded that even though the jury ruled against plaintiff on his federal claim, the preemption issue created a particularly good reason for exercising pendent jurisdiction in this case.
Brennan also held that the district court improperly instructed the jury on the conspiracy count, because the damages plaintiff was claiming must be proximately caused by violence or threats thereof, and that plaintiff had not shown "clear proof" that the UMW's management had endorsed violence as a means of settling the dispute (as required under the Norris-LaGuardia Act).
Concurring opinion
Justice Harlan wrote a brief concurrence, in which he agreed with Brennan's discussion of pendent jurisdiction, but disagreed with his interpretation of the standard of proof required for a claim under the Norris-LaGuardia Act.

Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75 (1947), is a 4-to-3 ruling by the United States Supreme Court which held that the Hatch Act of 1939, as amended in 1940, does not violate the First, Fifth, Ninth, or Tenth amendments to U.S. Constitution.. Moore, Constitutional Rights and Powers of the People, 1996, p. 203.
Background
At the start of the 20th century, several unions (such as the National Federation of Federal Employees, American Federation of Government Employees, and the United Federal Workers of America) began representing employees working for the federal government of the United States. The leadership of the United Federal Workers of America (UFWA) was leftist. The leadership was militant in its advocacy of the rights of its members and most of the national and local union leadership advocated leftist ideals; associated with left-wing intellectuals, activists, and political people; and supported left-wing organizations.Arnesen, "United Federal Workers of America/United Public Workers of America," in Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working-Class History, 2006, p. 1445. This led many politicians and others to believe the organization was Communist-controlled.
The political leanings of the UWFA led to passage of two pieces of legislation intended to restrict its political activities. In June 1938, Congress passed a rider to appropriations legislation which prevented the federal government from making payments (such as salaries) to any person or organization which advocated the overthrow of the federal government (as many communist organizations at the time proposed).Goldstein, Political Repression in Modern America: From 1870 to 1976, 2001, p. 244. In 1939, Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939, which restricted political campaign activities by federal employees. A provision of the Hatch Act made it illegal for the federal government to employ anyone who advocated the overthrow of the federal government. The UFWA immediately hired lawyer Lee Pressman to challenge the constitutionality of the Hatch Act.Gall, Pursuing Justice: Lee Pressman, the New Deal, and the CIO, 1999, p. 216. Various individual employees of the federal government, some of whom were members of the United Public Workers of America, sought an injunction against the second sentence of §9(a) of the Hatch Act, and a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 81-82.
On April 25, 1946, the State, County, and Municipal Workers of America (SCMWA) merged with the UFWA to form the United Public Workers of America.Lyons, Teachers and Reform: Chicago Public Education, 1929-1970, 2008, p. 104.Spero and Blum, Government As Employer, 1972, p. 214."New Union Urges Wider Labor Law," New York Times, April 26, 1946. Joining the new organization were several local unions which had been expelled from the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) for being communist-dominated.Slater, Public Workers: Government Employee Unions, the Law, and the State, 1900-1962, 2004, p. 126. Congress repeatedly investigated the union for violations of the Hatch Act and prohibitions on advocacy of the right to strike. In January 1947, the  House of Representatives Committee on Campaign Expenditures reported that it had found evidence that the UPWA (and other unions) had violated the Federal Corrupt Practices Act by failing to report expenditures in support of various political parties and candidates for federal office."Voting Inquiry Hits 60 Unions, 11 Firms," New York Times, January 3, 1947.
In the 19th century, American courts had established the "doctrine of privilege." This legal doctrine concluded that public employment was a privilege, not a right, and subsequently significant restrictions could be placed on public employees that could not be constitutionally tolerated in the private sector.Rosenbloom and O'Leary, Public Administration and Law, 1996, p. 190-191. By the middle of the 20th century, however, the doctrine of privilege had been markedly weakened.  Abuse of the privilege had led to widespread corruption; the tolerance of sexual harassment, racism, religious discrimination, and gender discrimination; and workplace abuse (such as forcing employees to buy goods and services from a supervisor, or forcing employees to run errands for the supervisor).Rosenbloom and O'Leary, Public Administration and Law, 1996, p. 191.  The courts were becoming less and less tolerant of the doctrine of privilege.Rabin, Hildreth, and Miller, Handbook of Public Administration,  2006, p. 673.
Decision
A significantly divided Supreme Court upheld the doctrine of privilege and the Hatch Act. Associate Justice Stanley Forman Reed wrote the decision for the majority.
Majority holding
Justice Reed initially dealt with an issue which arose due to the untimely filing of the appeal, and concluded the Court could hear the case.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 84-86.
On the substantive issues raised, Justice Reed noted that none of the appellants, except George P. Poole, had violated the provisions of the Hatch Act.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 83. Since the federal courts do not issue advisory rulings, Reed dismissed the issues raised by all appellants except Poole.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 89-90. Poole, however, had been charged with a violation of the Hatch Act, and an order for his dismissal entered by the government.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 90-91. (He was a ward executive committeeman for a political party, acted as a poll worker on election day, and acted as a paymaster for other poll workers engaged by that political party.)United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 94.
Poole contended that the Hatch Act violated the Ninth and Tenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Justice Reed also asserted (without explanation) that the Hatch Act implicated rights guaranteed by the First Amendment, and by implication the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment as well.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 95. Justice Reed found unpersuasive Poole's claim that off-hours political activity was different from such activity conducted during working hours. "The influence of political activity by government employees, if evil in its effects on the service, the employees or people dealing with them, is hardly less so because that activity takes place after hours." Reed next concluded that no rights guaranteed by the Constitution are absolute, and that all rights "are subject to the elemental need for order without which the guarantees of civil rights to others would be a mockery." But how should the rights of the Ninth and Tenth amendments be balanced against those of the First and Fifth?  Justice Reed found the majority's answer in the fact that the Ninth and Tenth amendments are reserved, rather than enumerated powers, and so carry less weight than enumerated powers.  He wrote:
The powers granted by the Constitution to the Federal Government are subtracted from the totality of sovereignty originally in the states and the people. Therefore, when objection is made that the exercise of a federal power infringes upon rights reserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, the inquiry must be directed toward the granted power under which the action of the Union was taken. If granted power is found, necessarily the objection of invasion of those rights, reserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, must fail.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 95-96.
Justice Reed then used a traditional balancing test to weight the infringement of First and Fifth amendment rights against "a congressional enactment to protect a democratic society against the supposed evil of political partisanship by classified employees of government."United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 96. That balance had been decided previously by the Court in Ex parte Curtis, 106 U.S. 371 (1882), and the infringements upheld. Without providing evidence or explanation, Reed asserted that the dangers posed by partisan political activity have only worsened since Curtis.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 97-98. Justice Reed next applied the balancing test to the doctrine of privilege.  Reed noted that in United States v. Wurzbach, 280 U.S. 396 (1930), the Court had upheld the doctrine of privilege in a single sentence against rights guaranteed by the Constitution.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 98.
Poole had argued that his actions were nonpartisan, however. The majority concluded that since Congress had seen fit to find danger in even nonpartisan political activity by federal workers, the Court would not dispute it.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 100-104. Reed note: "[Such restrictions have] the approval of long practice by the Commission, court decisions upon similar problems and a large body of informed public opinion. Congress and the administrative agencies have authority over the discipline and efficiency of the public service. When actions of civil servants in the judgment of Congress menace the integrity and the competency of the service, legislation to forestall such danger and adequate to maintain its usefulness is required. The Hatch Act is the answer of Congress to this need. We cannot say with such a background that these restrictions are unconstitutional."
The constitutionality of the Hatch Act was upheld, and the judgment of the district court affirmed.
Frankfurter's concurrence
Justice Felix Frankfurter concluded that the Supreme Court should not have accepted the case, as the appeal had been untimely filed.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 103 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Compelled to accept jurisdiction, however, by the majority, he concurred with the majority's reasoning on the substantive issues.
Black's dissent
Justice Hugo Black noted that the §9 of the statute made it illegal for federal workers to engage in political activity, and yet explicitly protected the right of workers to "express their opinions on all political subjects and candidates."United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 106-109 (Black, J., dissenting). Black also refused to accept the conclusions to be drawn from the doctrine of privilege: "Had this measure deprived five million farmers or a million businessmen of all right to participate in elections, because Congress thought that federal farm or business subsidies might prompt some of them to exercise, or be susceptible to, a corrupting influence on politics or government, I would not sustain such an Act on the ground that it could be interpreted so as to apply only to some of them."United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 109-110. Black concluded that, on its face, the Hatch Act and implementing civil service regulations were unconstitutionally overbroad (a fact even the government had admitted in its brief, Black said).United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 110.
Black provided a ringing defense of the right to freedom of speech.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 110-112. He dismissed out of hand the majority's reliance on Ex parte Curtis and United States v. Wurzbach (concluding that they did not support the conclusions the majority came to), and argued that corruption could be dealt with without resorting to the "muzzling" of six million people.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 112-114.
Rutledge's dissent
Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge concurred with Justice Black's dissent regarding Poole. He concurred with the majority that the case was not ripe regarding the other appellants.
Douglas' dissent
Justice William O. Douglas took issue with the majority on two grounds.  First, he would not have dismissed the claims of the 12 other appellants as unripe, arguing that consideration of a declaratory judgment in the case would be proper.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 115-120 (Douglas, J., dissenting).  Second, Douglas argued that Poole's position as an industrial worker at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was an important distinction. Administrative and political personnel may be susceptible to pressure and corruption via political activity, Douglas wrote, but industrial workers are "as remote from contact with the public or from policy making or from the functioning of the administrative process as a charwoman."United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 120-122, quoted at 122. Douglas concurred with Justice Black's dissent that the Hatch Act was overbroad in its application and approach to the problem of corruption.United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 123-126.
Assessment
United Public Workers v. Mitchell was the last time the Supreme Court expansively applied the doctrine of privilege. The Supreme Court largely rejected the doctrine in Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183 (1952), and a number of high court decisions in areas such as nonpartisan speech, due process, search and seizure, the right to marry, the right to bear children, equal protection, education, and receipt of public benefits over the next two decades continued to undermine the concept.Rabin, Hildreth, and Miller, Handbook of Public Administration,  2006, p. 672-674. Although the Supreme Court later reaffirmed United Public Workers v. Mitchell in 1973 in United States Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548 (1973), it did so narrowly on the grounds that permitting public employees to engage in political activity was dangerous.Menez, Vile, and Bartholomew, Summaries of Leading Cases on the Constitution, 2003, p. 287.
United Public Workers v. Mitchell is one of only seven Supreme Court decisions which addressed the Ninth or Tenth amendments prior to 1965.Caplan, "The History and Meaning of the Ninth Amendment," Virginia Law Review, March 1983, fn. 5; Matheson, "The Once and Future Ninth Amendment," Boston College Law Review, December 1996, fn. 93. It is the only one to do so in a substantive way.
Legal commentators have taken issues with the decision's characterization of the Ninth and Tenth amendments. One scholar has characterized the two amendments as a way to "reserve sovereign power rather than recogniz[e] any particular individual right", and as a means of emphasizing that the federal government's powers were enumerated, specific, and limited. This perspective leads to a criticism of United Public Workers v. Mitchell for seeing the amendments as subordinate to the enumerated powers in the Constitution. Another legal scholar has criticized Justice Reed's conception of the Ninth and Tenth amendments as "dubious" because: 1) It equates the meaning of the Ninth with the Tenth (which is clearly incorrect); 2) It leaves the two amendments completely subordinate to all enumerated powers and therefore meaningless; 3) It creates a situation where the Ninth Amendment interprets the Tenth Amendment, strengthening the Tenth Amendment and eviscerating Justice Reed's conclusion that the two amendments are subordinate.For additional views which see United Public Workers as improperly conflating the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, see: ; Sanders, "Ninth Life," supra at 770. Sanders agrees with Barnett that subordinating the Ninth and Tenth amendments leaves them essentially meaningless.
It may also be that the decision is in direct conflict with the intent of the Founding Fathers. In 1841, Secretary of State Daniel Webster, in a directive to heads of the federal agencies condemning the use of civil servants to political advantage, warned:
It is not intended that any officer shall be restrained in the free and proper expression and maintenance of his opinions respecting public men or public measures, or in the exercise to the fullest degree of the constitutional right of suffrage. But persons employed under the Government and paid for their services out of the public Treasury are not expected to take an active or officious part in attempts to influence the minds or votes of others, such conduct being deemed inconsistent with the spirit of the Constitution and the duties of public agents acting under it; and the President is resolved, so far as depends upon him, that while the exercise of the elective franchise by the people shall be free from undue influences of official station and authority, opinion shall also be free among the officers and agents of the Government.
One legal scholar has concluded that congressional debate in 1791 supports Webster's opinion, not the decision by Justice Reed in United Public Workers.

From "United States Civil Service Commission v. National Ass'n of Letter Carriers" ==> """
United States Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548 (1973), is a ruling by the United States Supreme Court which held that the Hatch Act of 1939 does not violate the First Amendment, and its implementing regulations are not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.
Background
In 1939, the United States Congress passed the Hatch Act, which barred federal employees from taking part in political campaigns. In United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75 (1947), the U.S. Supreme Court had held that the Act did not violate the First, Fifth, Ninth, or Tenth amendments to U.S. Constitution.Moore, Constitutional Rights and Powers of the People, 1996, p. 203. The same day, in Oklahoma v. United States Civil Service Commission, 330 U.S. 127 (1947), the Court rejected a similar Tenth Amendment challenge to the Act.
In 1971, six federal employees, the National Association of Letter Carriers, and six local Democratic and Republican political committees sought an injunction against the enforcement of the Hatch Act on the grounds that the law violated their First Amendment rights and was unconstitutionally vague.U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 551.
The United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that United Public Workers v. Mitchell had left the constitutionality of the term "political activity" open to question.U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 553-554. The District Court then found that the term was impermissibly vague and overbroad. The District Court then argued that, even if United Public Workers had foreclosed any discussion of the constitutionality of the term, subsequent Supreme Court decisions regarding the rights of federal workers had undermined the decision and left the door open for the District Court to re-examine the Act's constitutionality.
The federal government appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.
Decision
Majority opinion
Associate Justice Byron White wrote the decision for the majority.
Justice White began by noting that while the plaintiffs in United Public Workers had only made vague assertions of the kind of political activity they wished to engage in, the plaintiffs in the present case had clearly outlined the activities they believed were unconstitutionally barred by the Hatch Act.U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 554-555. White then "unhesitatingly reaffirm[ed] the Mitchell holding".U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 556. White reviewed the lengthy history in the U.S. of barring political activity by federal workers, a practice which extended to the presidency of Thomas Jefferson,U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 557-563. and emphasized the considered and lengthy history of the conclusion that such activity was highly dangerous to the proper functioning of government and democracy.U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 557, 563.
But, citing Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968), White noted that the government has a special and unique interest in regulating the speech of federal workers.U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 564. This special interest is not in question; rather, balancing this interest against the rights of workers is the key. Calling "the impartial execution of the laws" the "great end of Government", White asserted that not only is the actual impartiality of government but its appearance both justify the infringement of the rights of federal workers.U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 565, 567.
White next turned to the issue of vagueness.  White reviewed the adoption of the 1939 Act, the rulemaking of the United States Civil Service Commission between 1939 and 1940 (which defined many specific political acts barred by the 1939 legislation), and the adoption by Congress of amendments to the Hatch Act in 1940 which strictly limited the Civil Service Commission's rulemaking powers regarding the Act (as amended) but which also incorporated (almost, but not quite) the rules already promulgated by the Commission.U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 568-575. White concluded that these "prohibitions sufficiently clearly carve out the prohibited political conduct from the expressive activity permitted by the prior section to survive any attack on the ground of vagueness".U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 575-579, quoted at 579.
The judgment of the District Court was reversed.
Douglas' dissent
Associate Justice William O. Douglas dissented, joined by Associate Justices William J. Brennan, Jr. and Thurgood Marshall.
Douglas rejected the majority's conclusion that the Hatch Act of 1939 (as amended in 1940) was constitutionally not vague.  He noted that more than 3,000 rulings of the Civil Service Commission had been made between the first adoption of the prohibition on political activity in 1886 and 1940, along with 800 decisions since then.U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 595-596. The sheer mass of decisions indicated that the legislation's phrase "political activity" was vague.  But Douglas also noted that many of the decisions and rulings were themselves unclear and vague.U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 596. "The chilling effect of these vague and generalized prohibitions," Douglas concluded, "is so obvious as not to need elaboration."
Douglas observed that the Supreme Court had already abandoned the "doctrine of privilege" defense for the Hatch Act, and had only in 1972 held "that Government employment may not be denied or penalized "on a basis that infringes [the employee's] constitutionally protected interests -- especially, his interest in freedom of speech."U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 597, quoting Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593 (1972), at 597. Douglas equated freedom of speech with freedom of religion, and concluded that "speech, assembly, and petition are as deeply embedded in the First Amendment as proselytizing a religious cause."U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 598. If the Court would not condition public employment based on a religious test, it should not therefore base employment on a political test (e.g., nonpartisanship).
Douglas agreed with the District Court that a number of Supreme Court decisions since United Public Workers had called into question the Hatch Act's constitutionality.U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 598-599. For Douglas, the majority's long discussion of the 1940 amendments boiled down to one thing: Congress had refused to delegate to the Civil Service Commission the authority to regulate First Amendment rights, and this fatally left the Act uninterpreted and thus unconstitutionally vague.U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 599.
Douglas would have struck down the Act as "self-imposed censorship imposed on many nervous people who live on narrow economic margins."U.S. Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 600.
Assessment
In the 19th century, American courts had established the "doctrine of privilege." This legal doctrine concluded that public employment was a privilege, not a right, and subsequently significant restrictions could be placed on public employees that could not be constitutionally tolerated in the private sector.Rosenbloom and O'Leary, Public Administration and Law, 1996, p. 190-191. By the middle of the 20th century, however, the doctrine of privilege had been markedly weakened.  Abuse of the privilege had led to widespread corruption; the tolerance of sexual harassment, racism, religious discrimination, and gender discrimination; and workplace abuse (such as forcing employees to buy goods and services from a supervisor, or forcing employees to run errands for the supervisor).Rosenbloom and O'Leary, Public Administration and Law, 1996, p. 191.  The courts were becoming less and less tolerant of the doctrine of privilege.Rabin, Hildreth, and Miller, Handbook of Public Administration,  2006, p. 673.
United Public Workers v. Mitchell was the last time the Supreme Court expansively applied the doctrine of privilege. The Supreme Court largely rejected the doctrine in Wieman v.

Although the Supreme Court reaffirmed United Public Workers v. Mitchell in United States Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, it abandoned its reliance on the doctrine of privilege and did so narrowly on the grounds that permitting public employees to engage in political activity was dangerous to democracy.Menez, Vile, and Bartholomew, Summaries of Leading Cases on the Constitution, 2003, p. 287.

From "United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press" ==> """
United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989), was a case before the United States Supreme Court.
Background
Facts
Journalists requested, under the Freedom of Information Act (United States) (FOIA), that the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) disclose any criminal records in its possession concerning four brothers whose family company allegedly had obtained defense contracts through an improper arrangement with a corrupt Congressman. The Department released only the "rap sheet" of the fourth, deceased brother.
The journalists sued in District Court, limiting their request to documents containing information that was a matter of public record. While the suit was pending, two more of the brothers died, and the FBI (1) released the requested data concerning those brothers, (2) indicated that any financial crime information about the remaining brother could be disclosed in the public interest, but that no such information existed, and (3) refused to release any rap sheet or other records containing nonfinancial criminal information about him.
District Court
The District Court, granting the Department's motion for summary judgment after an in camera review of the requested information, held that such information was exempted from FOIA's disclosure requirements by various FOIA provisions, including Exemption 7(C) (5 USCS 552(b)(7)(C)), which applies to investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes where production of such records could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
D.C. Circuit
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that 
(1) Exemption 7(C) was inapplicable, because, in the absence of any statutory standards by which to judge the public interest in disclosure, a court should be bound by state and local determinations that such information should be made available to the general public, and
(2) no other FOIA exemptions were applicable.
Accordingly, the Court of Appeals directed the District Court to determine, on remand, whether the withheld information was publicly available at its source, and if so, whether the Department might satisfy its statutory obligation by referring the journalists to the enforcement agency or agencies that had provided the original information.
D.C. Circuit rehearing
On rehearing, the Court of Appeals, modifying its holding, said that most state policies in fact did not favor disclosure of rap sheets, but that the District Court should nonetheless make a factual determination whether the remaining brother's privacy interest in his rap-sheet information had faded because such information appeared on the public record. The Court of Appeals subsequently denied rehearing en banc.
Issue
The Supreme Court accepted the case on certiorari to resolve whether disclosure of the rap sheet constituted an unwarranted invasion of privacy within the meaning of 5 U.S.C.S. § 552(b)(7)(C).
Opinion of the Court
The Supreme Court reversed. In an opinion by Justice Stevens, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White, Marshall, O'Connor, Scalia and Kennedy, it was held that
(1) while a court must balance the public interest in disclosure of criminal records against the individual privacy interests protected by Exemption 7(C), a categorical balance may properly be undertaken, and individual circumstances may properly be disregarded, when the case fits into a genus in which the balance characteristically tips in one direction;
(2) as a categorical matter, the granting of a third party's FOIA request for the disclosure of law enforcement records or information about a private citizen can reasonably be expected to invade that citizen's privacy for the purpose of Exemption 7(C), and when such a request seeks no official information about a Federal Government agency, but merely seeks records that the Federal Government happens to be storing, the invasion of privacy is "unwarranted" for the purpose of Exemption 7(C); and
(3) in any event the public interest in the release of the requested information about the remaining brother was not the type of interest protected by FOIA, because--although there is some public interest in anyone's criminal history, especially if the history is in some way related to the subject's dealing with a public official or agency--FOIA's central purpose is to insure that the Federal Government's activities be opened to public scrutiny, not that information about private citizens that happens to be in the Federal Government's warehouse be so disclosed, and the release of information as to the brother's past arrests or convictions would tell nothing directly about the character of the Congressman's behavior or about the conduct of the Defense Department in awarding contracts to the brother's company.
The Court held that the fact that an event was not wholly "private" did not mean that an individual had no interest in limiting its disclosure. The privacy interest in a rap sheet was substantial. Whether an invasion of privacy was warranted had to turn on the nature of the requested document and its relationship to the basic purpose of the FOIA, which focused on the citizen's right to be informed about the government's actions. The news groups in this case did not intend to discover anything about the conduct of the agency, and response to the request would not shed any light on the agency's conduct. Thus, the public interest in release of a rap sheet was not the type of interest protected by the FOIA. The Court held, as a categorical matter under § 552(b)(7)(C), that a third party's request for law enforcement records about a private citizen could reasonably be expected to invade that citizen's privacy, and that when the request sought no official information about the government, the privacy invasion was unwarranted.
Concurrence
Justice Blackmun, joined by Brennan, concurred in the judgment. He felt that 
(1) the court's use of categorical balancing under Exemption 7(C) was not basically sound, and
(2) Exemption 7(C) should not be interpreted as exempting all rap-sheet information from FOIA's disclosure requirements, but
(3) even a more flexible balancing approach would still require reversing the Court of Appeals in the case at bar.

United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954),. is a landmark United States Supreme Court case, in administrative law, in which the Court held that administrative agencies in the Federal Government are obliged to follow their own regulations, policies and procedures. Under the Accardi Doctrine, federal agencies which do not follow their own regulations or procedures run the risk of having their actions invalidated if challenged in court. 
The Accardi doctrine was later strengthened in Service v. Dulles 354 US 363 (1957)  and Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 US 535 (1959)  
Due to a ruling in United States v. Fausto,  the doctrine generally does not apply to Federal employment decisions that are covered by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.

From "United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York" ==> """
United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York, 556 U.S. 928 (2009), is a United States Supreme Court decision holding that where the Government has not intervened or actively participated, private plaintiffs under the False Claims Act must file an appeal within 30 days of the judgment or order being appealed, according to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure..
 Background 
The Eisenstein case arose out of New York City's decision to require government employees who do not live in the City to pay a fee equivalent to the municipal income taxes paid by employees who do live there. Irwin Eisenstein and four other city employees who do not live in New York sued the city, pro se (i.e., representing themselves without being represented by attorneys), alleging that the policy violated – among other things – the federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil liability on any person who “knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or employee of the United States Government . . . a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.” The False Claims Act is unique because, while the federal government is always the "real party in interest" (as the one allegedly being defrauded), the statute allows a private plaintiff (known as a "relator" under the FCA) to sue qui tam (on the government's behalf) since the relator is "partially assigned" part of the government's legal injury.See Nathan D. Sturycz, The King and I?: An Examination of the Interest Qui Tam Relators Represent and the Implications for Future False Claims Act Litigation, 28 St. Louis Pub. L. Rev. 459 (2009), available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=1537749
The False Claims Act provides:
Despite this provision, the United States does not need to participate in False Claims Act litigation. After conducting an investigation, the government may choose to intervene and take over the litigation. However, even if it decides not to do so, the FCA statute provides the government a right to be involved in the action and to receive a majority share of any monetary recovery. The government also has a right to intervene later, if it can show good cause for doing this.  Where the government does not intervene, the False Claims Act provides the government a right to receive copies of the parties' pleadings and deposition transcripts (rights usually reserved for parties to a suit).
The district court dismissed Eisenstein's claim for failure to state a claim and entered final judgment in favor of the City of New York. Eisenstein filed notice of appeal from that judgment 54 days later. Six months after Eisenstein filed his notice of appeal, the Second Circuit ordered the parties to brief the issue of what time limit for filing the notice of appeal applied in this case, where the action was conducted in the name of the United States but the government had declined to intervene. Rule 4(a)(1)(A) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (FRAP) gives a party 30 days to appeal in a civil case, but the rule gives “any party” 60 days to appeal when the United States is a party to the action. The City of New York later filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely.
The Second Circuit concluded that because the United States was not a “party” to the action, the special FRAP 60-day time limit did not apply. Therefore, it dismissed the appeal as untimely.Text of Second Circuit Opinion http://www.precydent.com/OriginalVersion/06-3329-cv.pdf?id=345879
 Case 
The Supreme Court of the United States granted the petition for certiorari, allowing it to review the case, in January 2009.
The petitioner (Eisenstein & co.) argued that the government was considered both a "party in interest" and a "party" under the FCA statute.Briefs of Petitioner http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/08-660_Petitioner.pdf; http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/08-660_PetitionerReply.pdf As a result, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure would have allowed petitioners 60 days to file their appeal, and the Second Circuit would likely have been found to have had jurisdiction to hear their appeal.
The respondent (the City of New York) argued that only individuals or entities that actually participate in and control the qui tam litigation can qualify as “parties” to an action. Because the Government neither intervened nor participated in the qui tam action, and it could not have appealed the decision without first seeking leave to do so, the respondents argued that the 30 day time limit set out in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure should apply.Brief of Respondent http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/08-660_Respondent.pdf
Three amicus briefs were filed in the case as well.Brief for Taxpayers Against Fraud Education Fund in Support of Petitioner http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/08-660_PetitionerAmCuTAF.pdfBrief for Patricia Haight and In Defense of Animals in Support of Petitioner http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/08-660_PetitionerAmCuPHaightandInDefenseofAnimals.pdfBrief for the United States of America in Support of Respondent http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/08-660_RespondentAmCuUSA.pdf
Oral arguments indicated that Congress provided no express answer within the False Claims Act text or legislative history regarding whether the United States should be considered a "party" to a qui tam action when it declines to intervene. As both parties pointed out, a qui tam action is unique and the government has unique rights, even when it declines to intervene; it is not a stranger to the litigation. By the terms of the statute, the government is the "real party in interest" in an FCA suit. The United States is also named in the caption of the case, and it receives the bulk of any monetary recovery. In sum, the United States bears some of the characteristics of a party and some characteristics of a non-party.Oral Argument Transcript https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-660.pdf
Associate Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for a unanimous Court, holding that the FRAP 30-day time limit applies to a private relator's claim under the False Claims Act where the government has not intervened.  Thus, the Court affirmed the Second Circuit's finding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal of the dismissal of the private parties' suit against New York since the appeal had been filed in an untimely manner.

From "United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles" ==> """
United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U.S. 11 (1955), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that expanded the rights of citizens to civilian trials, holding that an ex-serviceman cannot be court-martialed for crimes alleged during his military service.
The United States Air Force alleged that the petitioner, Robert W. Toth, committed a murder while he was on active duty in Korea. (On Sept  27, 1952 while on guard duty at a air base in South Korea, Toth and airman Thomas Kinder had taken into custody a drunken South Korean Civilian named Bang Soon Kil who had grabbed at Toth arm who then pistol-whipped the Civilian. Toth and Kinder were ordered by their superior Lt George Schreiber to kill Bang. Schreiber and Kinder then still in the military were court-martialed: Schreiber was sentenced to life in prison (reduced to 5 years in prison; forfeiture of pay and dishonorable discharge-he served 20 months before being dismissed from service); Kinder was sentenced to life sentence (reduced to two years in prison and a dishonorable discharge; the discharge was later suspended, allowing him to return to service).Encylopeida Toth vs QuarlesThey argued that while they knew about the murder while Toth was in the armed forces, they didn't know the identity of the man who did it so Toth was honorably discharged. Donald A. Quarles, at the time the Secretary of the Air Force, argued that as the crimes occurred during Toth's military service, the military could constitutionally try him. (Syllabus)
The case mostly dealt with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), a 1950 law passed by the 81st United States Congress and signed by President Harry S. Truman, and whether or not certain provisions of it were constitutional; that is to say, whether or not Congress could deprive ex-service members of their Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.
In the majority opinion, decided 6–3, Justice Hugo Black wrote that "[the UCMJ] is not a valid exercise of the power granted Congress in Article I of the Constitution." (Opinion of the Court) The decision in Quarles would prove as an important precedent which the Court would rely on two years later in the landmark Reid v. Covert ruling. "Just last Term, this Court held in United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, that military courts could not constitutionally try a discharged serviceman for an offense which he had allegedly committed while in the armed forces. [...] There are no supportable grounds upon which to distinguish the Toth case from the present cases.  Toth, Mrs. Covert, and Mrs. Smith were all civilians.  All three were American citizens.  All three were tried for murder.  All three alleged crimes were committed in a foreign country." Whereas Quarles dealt with the case of an ex-servicemember, Covert would deny the government the ability to try any US citizen by military tribunal, even citizens abroad. This important precedent was re-affirmed in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2004), where the Court ruled that while the US government may detain enemy combatants abroad, those detained must have "the ability to challenge their enemy combatant status before an impartial authority" for the detention to be constitutional.
Those who dissented gave various reasons. While Justice Sherman Minton agreed that civilians "not under the jurisdiction of the Military Code" have a right to a civilian trial, he argued that the Court had erred because Toth was not a "full-fledged civilian". (Dissent of J. Minton) Justice Stanley F. Reed on the other hand, argued that the solution to the question should have come from Congress amending the UCMJ and not via a Court order. (Dissent of J. Reed)
As regards Toth, civilian authorities would never retry him; a 1989 article in the Military Law Review declares: "Toth literally got away with murder."

United States ex rel. West v.

The United States promised to allot  to each member of the Wichita band of Indians under the Act of March 2, 1895, 28 Stat. 876, 895.  This promise may confer a right on every single member of the band, but the primary decision as to who the members are must come from the Secretary of the Interior, and, in the absence of any indication in the act to allow an appeal to the courts for applicants who are dissatisfied, mandamus will not issue to require the Secretary to approve the selection of one claiming to be an adopted member of the tribe but whose application the Secretary has denied.
In view of long established practice of the Department of the Interior, and the undoubted power of Congress over the Indians, this Court will hesitate to construe the language of §§ 441, 463, Rev.Stat., as not giving the Department of the Interior control over the adoption of whites into the Indian tribes.

From "United States Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club" ==> """
United States Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club, Inc., 592 U.S. ___ (2021), was a Supreme Court of the United States case involving whether the use of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request can be used to access documents from a U.S. agency that are protected under the deliberative process privilege exemption, in this specific case, draft biological opinions made and reviewed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) prior to a final rulemaking decision by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) related to impacts on endangered aquatic species, requested by the Sierra Club. The Court ruled in a 7–2 decision in 2021 that the government does not have to disclose "draft biological opinions" involving potential threats to endangered species, even though the drafts reflect an agency's final proposal.  The ruling limits environmental groups' ability to obtain government documents using the FOIA. 
Background
In 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a new rule for using water from natural sources for cooling of industrial equipment. Since aquatic species may be drawn up in the uptake of this water, including endangered species, the EPA was required under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to consult with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to determine if this rule would properly safeguard 
endangered species before finalizing the rule. This included creating biological opinions on whether the EPA's rule put endangered species in jeopardy or not.
Over the next two years, the EPA consulted with the FWS and NMFS adjusting the proposed rule to address initial concerns. The FWS and NMFS agreed to provide the biological opinions that the Endangered Species Act required, and had developed draft versions by the end of 2013 that both stated that the EPA's proposed rule (as amended through 2013) would put endangered species in jeopardy. Instead of sharing these with the EPA, both the FWS and NMFS decided instead to extend their consultations with the EPA into 2014. After a few months, the EPA released a new proposed rule that was significantly different from the original 2011 rule. The FWS and NFMS subsequently provided "no jeopardy" biological opinions to the EPA that supported implementation of the new rule. The EPA formally issued this new rule in March 2014 after receiving these reports.
The Sierra Club sought information on the background of this rule by using Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to obtain all the documentation behind its development. While both the FWS and NMFS provided much of their documentation in their consultation period with the EPA, they did not provide the 2013 draft biological opinions, asserting these were protected by deliberative process privilege, one of the allowed FOIA exemptions, and previously affirmed by case law in 1975 by NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. as to protect "documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated". The Sierra Club was seeking to obtain these draft opinions of the EPA regarding rules governing underwater structures used to cool industrial equipment. Specifically, the Sierra Club wanted to see the report about how the intake systems could harm endangered species.  The Sierra Club sued in the Northern District of California for release of these draft opinions, since they reflected on the state of the proposed 2013 EPA rather than its final 2014 rule. The district court agreed with the Sierra Club in July 2017 and ordered release of the drafts, which was upheld on appeal by the government by the Ninth Circuit in December 2018.
Supreme Court
The agencies petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case on the question of whether the draft documents were covered under the deliberative process privilege. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in March 2020, with oral arguments on November 2, 2020. In the interim, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed as her replacement in October 2020; this became her first case on the Supreme Court.
The Court issued its ruling on March 4, 2021. In her first merit opinion, Justice Barrett wrote the majority opinion, her first majority opinion, joined by all but Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor in the 7–2 decision. The majority ruled in favor of the FWS and NMFS, reversing the Ninth Circuit's decision and remanding the case for further review. Barrett stated that the 2013 draft biological opinions were, within the scope of the deliberative process, "drafts of a draft" and not treated as drafts of a final view on the 2013 rule, and thus were protected information within the FOIA exemption.
 Dissent 
Justice Breyer wrote a dissent, joined by Sotomayor. Breyer agreed in the principle that draft copies well prior to any final report would be protected under the deliberative process privilege, but argued that the 2013 drafts were not simply drafts but one step removed from final biological opinions, given the procedural history, and thus should not have been protected from the FOIA exemption.
Breyer argued that because the EPA uses information from drafts to make final decisions, the Sierra Club must be permitted to obtain the drafts. He wrote: "Agency practice shows that the Draft Biological Opinion, not the Final Biological Opinion, is the document that informs the EPA of the Services’ conclusions about jeopardy and alternatives and triggers within the EPA the process of deciding what to do about those conclusions. If a Final Biological Opinion is discoverable under FOIA, as all seem to agree it is, why would a Draft Biological Opinion, embodying the same Service conclusions (and leaving the EPA with the same four choices), not be?” Breyer also noted the rarity of final biological opinions.  He also wrote:"To hold that Draft Biological Opinions are discoverable when a private party seeks an EPA permit but not when, as here, the EPA seeks to write a generally applicable rule that governs private party conduct seems highly anomalous. Even where there is no private applicant, the evaluating agencies have a long history of disclosing Draft Biological Opinions to the public.”

From "United States Forest Service v. Cowpasture River Preservation Assn." ==> """
United States Forest Service v. Cowpasture River Preservation Assn., 590 U.S. ___ (2020), was a United States Supreme Court case involving the permitting of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline under the Appalachian Trail in the George Washington National Forest. At issue were conflicting agencies and laws for those agencies. The permit was issued by United States Forest Service (USFS) which has responsibility of the national forest, while the Trail itself is part of the National Park Service (NPS), and which under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 does not allow any other government agency to issue right of way permits through its lands. In the 7–2 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that due to how the NPS was assigned the Trail by the Department of the Interior, it did not transform the lands within the trail to lands of the NPS and were still within the USFS's purview, and thus ruled that the USFS could issue the permit. The case had been consolidated with Atlantic Coast Pipeline LLC v. Cowpasture River Preservation Association  (Docket 18-1587).
Background
The Atlantic Coast Pipeline project was a private development by the joint venture of Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC of several energy companies to bring natural gas from wells in West Virginia, through Virginia, and then to a terminus in North Carolina and then onto other parts of the U.S. eastern seaboard, with a significant portion of this to be exported to India and Japan. Planning for the pipeline had started in 2013, and has become a high-value project under the Trump administration. The project drew a great deal of opposition from residents in the affected areas, businesses, and environmentalists. Legal actions to block permits and alter the project's plans raised the cost projects from  to  by 2020, and delayed the plan to break ground on the pipeline in late 2017.
thumb|left|Proposed route of the pipeline. The red box marks the approximate location where the pipeline would cross under the Appalachian Trail.
A key right of way permit for the pipeline was for crossing the George Washington National Forest, which covers the Appalachian Mountains along the border of West Virginia and Virginia. The George Washington National Forest was established as a national forest and part of the United States' public lands in 1918, and entrusted to the United States Forest Service (USFS). Via the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and subsequent amendments, agencies like the USFS may issue special use right of way permits for public lands under their authority.
The USFS became involved early in the planning process of the pipeline around April 2015, commenting on early Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for the project. The USFS had asserted that the EIS needed to evaluate alternate plans that would not use the national forest, as their policy was to only issued special-use permits on forest lands for cases which "cannot reasonably be accommodated on non-National Forest System lands". Though subsequent draft EIS included two of ten promised alternative routes, the USFS stated they could not assess these until the full evaluation was completed. However, by 2017 with the developer's original deadlines nearing, the USFS told the developers and FERC that they were satisfied with having the two alternatives to allow FERC to issue its final EIS by July 2017, and subsequently, granted the special use permits to the pipeline by January 2018. The permits allowed for about  of pipeline to pass  under the Appalachian Trail. One of the plaintiffs in the suit, the Southern Environmental Law Center, said that the change in the USFS stance appeared to be tied to Donald Trump taking office and indicate pressure on the USFS by the President to push the project through.
A collation of environmental groups, led by the Cowpasture River Preservation Association and including the Sierra Club, the Southern Environmental Law Center, the Shenandoah Valley Network and the Virginia Wilderness Committee, filed suit against the USFS' action in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in February 2018. The collation argued that the USFS's decision violated its authority under the Mineral Leasing Act and the National Forest Management Act of 1976, and acted "arbitrarily and capriciously" under the National Environmental Policy Act and Administrative Procedure Act. The Fourth Circuit ruled on December 13, 2018 against the USFS and vacated the special use permit. The three-judge court unanimously agreed that the USFS's decision to grant the permit "is particularly informed by the Forest Service's serious environmental concerns that were suddenly, and mysteriously, assuaged in time to meet a private pipeline company's deadlines". The court further ruled that the USFS did not have the authority over the land use of the Appalachian Trail, which by the National Trails System Act of 1968 had been designed as a National Park by the United States Department of the Interior under authority of the National Park Service (NPS), and which the amendments to the Mineral Leasing Act by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, were exempted from being granted for use for right-of-way permits under . The court also ruled on two other points, asserting that the USFS permit failed to account for mandatory environmental regulations to protect the land and ecology, and that the permitting did not perform enough evaluation of the risk related to landslides and erosion due to the steep lands in the area. The decision of the court was noted to end with a quote from The Lorax: "We trust the United States Forest Service to 'speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues.'"
Supreme Court
Both the USFS and the project developers petitioned the Fourth Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court specifically on the USFS's authority to issue the special use permit for lands covered by the Appalachian Trail. They expressed concern that the Fourth Circuit's decision related to the Appalachian Trail "has effectively erected a 2,200-mile barrier severing the eastern seaboard from oil and gas sources west of the Appalachian Trail". Both petitions asked the Court to review whether the USFS does have the ability to issue right of way special use permits for the lands traversed by the Appalachian Trail. The Supreme Court certified the case in October 2019. Oral arguments were heard on February 24, 2020. The arguments examined what ramifications the Fourth Circuit's decision would have if it were held, that many numerous pipelines and similar projects had already been built to cross the Appalachian Trail before it was established as a national park in 1968, and how the concept of "land" versus "right of way" could be reconciled between the USFS and NPS's oversight in this area.
The Court's decision was issued on June 15, 2020. In the 7–2 decision, the court ruled that under National Trails System Act, the Appalachian Trail was established as a right of way through the national forest, established through agreements between the Department of the Interior and the USFS, and did not transform that land into national park land. Therefore, the land the Trail occupies remains as land within the jurisdiction of USFS, and thus they were empowered to issue the special use permit under the Mineral Leasing Act.
The majority opinion was written by Justice Clarence Thomas. He summarized the judgement, "The lands that the trail crosses are still 'federal lands' and the Forest Service may grant a pipeline right of way through them — just as it granted a right of way for the trail. Sometimes a complicated regulatory scheme may cause us to miss the forest for the trees. But at bottom, these cases boil down to a simple proposition: A trail is a trail, and land is land."
Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the dissenting opinion joined by Justice Elena Kagan. Sotomayor stated the majority decision was "inconsistent with the language of three statutes, long-standing agency practice, and common sense", and that "Only Congress, not this court, should change that mandate [of permitting pipelines across federally-owned lands]".
The Supreme Court decision reversed the Fourth Circuit's judgement and remanded the case for review. The decision only addressed the question of the USFS's ability to issue permits, and did not touch on the three other factors from the Fourth Circuit's opinion: that the USFS's permit did not comply with mandatory standards for protecting the environment, that the evaluation did not properly evaluate soil and erosion concerns, and whether the USFS's decision to issue the permits were arbitrary and capricious.
Aftermath
On July 5, 2020, the companies seeking to build the pipeline announced they had canceled the project due to other lingering legal challenges raised by opponents of the project, unrelated to the right of way permit at the center of this case.

From "United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film" ==> """
United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, 413 U.S. 123 (1973), was an in rem case decided by the United States Supreme Court that considered the question of whether the First Amendment required that citizens be allowed to import obscene material for their personal and private use at home, which was already held to be protected several years earlier. By a 5–4 margin, the Court held that it did not.
This case was very similar to United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, a case the Court had heard two years earlier. It began when the films, and other visual and textual material with predominant explicit sexual content, were seized by customs agents from Paladini, a California man returning from Mexico. Federal law at the time prohibited the import of any material that might be judged to be obscene. Paladini challenged the forfeiture proceedings the government initiated, on the grounds that he intended the material for his personal use in the privacy of his own home, an activity the Court had ruled was protected under the First Amendment in Stanley v. Georgia. Thus, he argued, he had a right to obtain such material abroad for that purpose.
After a district court panel agreed with him and declared the statute unconstitutional, the case went to the Supreme Court directly. Its opinion was one of four obscenity cases handed down, along with Miller v. California, in which the Court announced a new standard of obscenity for the first time since Roth v. United States 17 years before. By a 5–4 margin, the Court held that the statute was constitutional, but it also ordered the district court to review the material under its new standard and consider whether it was still obscene.
Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote for the majority, reaffirming a similar holding in Thirty-seven Photographs that the right to possess something in one's home which might otherwise be unlawful outside of it did not give rise to a right to import it. William O. Douglas wrote a lengthy dissent, responding as much to the majority holding in Miller, arguing that history showed obscenity laws were not vigorously enforced at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted and thus could not be justified on traditionalist grounds. William Brennan wrote a shorter dissent, joined by the other two justices, calling the statute overbroad.
Background of the case
For most of American history, literary and artistic works depicting, or even alluding to, sexual acts and topics or using profane language had been banned from publication or distribution, often by both confiscation of the works themselves and criminal prosecution of all individuals involved, following the traditions of English common law on obscenity and statutes at the state and federal levels. At the same time, demand for such materials continued, and the laws were often widely flouted. No defendant or claimant in such an action had ever persuaded a court to entertain the argument that the First Amendment's guarantees of free speech and free expression barred them.
That began to change during the 20th century, in response to social and cultural trends of greater tolerance for literature and art that depicted such proscribed material. In the landmark 1933 case United States v. One Book Called Ulysses, Judge John M. Woolsey of the Southern District of New York ruled that James Joyce's novel Ulysses, chapters of which had been held obscene over a decade earlier when published in a literary review, could not be barred from the United States purely on the basis of its language and content without considering its literary merit.United States v. One Book Called Ulysses, 5 F.Supp. 182 (S.D.N.Y., 1933). Second Circuit judges Learned and Augustus Hand upheld Woolsey on appeal,United States v. One Book Entitled Ulysses, by James Joyce, 72 F.2d 705 (2nd Cir., 1934) and the book, considered a masterpiece of modernist literature, could be freely published and sold.
Censorship battles continued in the next decades over other works of literature and art, such as Lady Chatterley's Lover, expanding to include films. In 1957, the Supreme Court finally considered a case arising from an obscenity prosecution, Roth v. United States.Roth v. United States, . William Brennan wrote for a 6–3 majority that upheld the criminal conviction but abandoned the century-old Hicklin test in favor of a narrower definition of obscenity. It did not settle the issue, however, and the Warren Court had to hear more cases arising from subsequent prosecutions in the next decade, during which the Sexual Revolution began a more direct challenge to social mores on the issue.
In some of those cases, like Memoirs v. Massachusetts, the justices realized their Roth standard was inadequate, but they could not agree on a new one.Memoirs v. Massachusetts, . The search for a workable legal definition of obscenity led to Potter Stewart's famous line "I know it when I see it" in Jacobellis v. Ohio.Jacobellis v. Ohio, . Other Court decisions restricted the scope under which obscenity could be suppressed. Freedman v. Maryland held that local film boards could not ban films, effectively eliminating them, and that they had to approve a film within a specified period of time.Freedman v. Maryland, . In Stanley v. Georgia, the Court held that possession of obscene material in the privacy of the home was constitutionally protected as well.Stanley v. Georgia, .
United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs
United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, like its companion case United States v. Reidel,United States v. Reidel, . was a Stanley-inspired challenge to the laws against the distribution of obscenity. In October 1969, Milton Luros, an adult-magazine publisher from Southern California, had challenged the seizure of the photographs, depicting naked heterosexual couples in various sexual positions, on his return to Los Angeles from Europe. He claimed he later planned to use them to illustrate a copy of the Kama Sutra.United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, .
In addition to arguing that Stanley gave him the right to import such material, Luros also challenged the procedures of the case under the Fifth Amendment, pointing out that the statute, Section 1305 of Title 18 of the United States Code, did not give a time frame within which the government had to begin forfeiture proceedings against the seized material and did not even require the government move in a timely fashion. A panel of two judges from the Central District of California and one judge from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with him on the Stanley claim but found the lack of a time limit alone enough to hold Section 1305 unconstitutional.United States v. Thirty-seven (37) Photographs, 390 F.Supp. 36, 37 (C.D. Cal., 1970).
The statute provided for direct appeal to the Supreme Court, which heard the case in 1971. By a 6–3 margin, the Supreme Court reversed the district court panel. "[A] port of entry is not a traveler's home," Justice Byron White wrote for the majority. "His right to be let alone neither prevents the search of his luggage nor the seizure of unprotected, but illegal, materials when his possession of them is discovered during such a search."Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 376, White, J. Justice White found the Stanley argument less applicable, since Luros had admitted to the intent of commercial use.
However, Justice White agreed that without a time limit for when forfeiture proceedings had to begin, Section 1305 was an unconstitutional violation of due-process rights. Since Court doctrine holds that if it is possible to construe a statute in a way that avoids the constitutional question, it should be done, White construed Section 1305 to require a 14-day maximum time-frame from initial seizure to forfeiture filing.Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 371–73. In separate concurrences, John Marshall Harlan II defended the statute against Luros's claim it was overbroadThirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 377–78, Harlan, J., concurring. and Potter Stewart indicated his disagreement with the majority holding that Stanley did not extend to importing obscene material.Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 378–79, Stewart, J., concurring.
In dissent, Hugo Black, joined by William O. Douglas, reiterated his opposition to legally enforceable obscenity, and he attacked the majority both for usurping the legislative prerogative of imposing a time limit where there had been none and not extending Stanley: "The right to read and view any literature and pictures at home is hollow indeed if it does not include a right to carry that material privately in one's luggage when entering the country."Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. at 379, 380 et seq., Black, J., dissenting. Thurgood Marshall's dissent was at Reidel, where he felt that, since Luros had those pictures in his private personal possession when he cleared customs, Stanley was applicable.Reidel, 402 U.S. at 361, Marshall, J., dissenting.
Underlying dispute
Paladini returned to Los Angeles International Airport after a trip to Mexico in April 1970. Customs agents inspecting his belongings discovered "movie films, color slides, photographs, and other printed and graphic material" of a possibly obscene nature, and confiscated them, without charging Paladini. Paladini claimed that they were for his own personal use, and he challenged the asset forfeiture proceedings as Luros had before him.United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, , 125, Burger, C.J. Since he had not been criminally charged, the case was an in rem civil forfeiture action, with the reels of film and other items named as defendants.
Unlike Luros, he alleged no procedural defect in Section 1305. Instead, he argued that the entire statute was unconstitutional, since Stanley v. Georgia had held that the First Amendment protected the right to possess, read and view obscene material in the home and that allowed him to import such material for that use. The district court panel agreed, citing Thirty-seven Photographs, and struck down the statute. Again, the government appealed directly to the Supreme Court.
Before the Court
The Court, as it had in Thirty-seven Photographs, granted certiorari and agreed to hear the case.  Oral argument in Reels of Film was held in January 1972, with no decision for the rest of the term, since the Court had agreed to take some other obscenity cases.  Before the beginning of the October 1972 term, Justices Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II retired, their deaths imminent. President Richard Nixon appointed William Rehnquist and Lewis Powell to replace them. Arguments were reheard in November 1972.
Thomas Kuchel, recently defeated in his re-election bid for his U.S. Senate seat from California, argued the case for the claimant at rehearing, by invitation of the Court. Solicitor General Erwin Griswold argued the case for the government. Amicus curiae briefs were filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and First Amendment Lawyers Association in support.
Decision
In June 1973, near the end of the term, the Court handed down its opinion in all five cases. In Miller v. California, it succeeded, where it had failed seven years earlier in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, producing a new standard for obscenity that superseded the 1957 Roth v. United States holding. Miller impacted all the cases decided that day.
As he had in Miller, Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote for a five-justice majority in Reels of Film. He reaffirmed the Thirty-seven Photographs holding on the import ban, finding no distinction for private use and noting how holding it a protected activity could create a loophole that would make other laws intended to suppress the domestic distribution of obscenity ineffectual. However, in this case, the majority ordered the case remanded to district court to determine whether Paladini's materials were obscene under Miller, which called for "contemporary community standards" to be applied, rather than a national standard.
William O. Douglas wrote a lengthy dissent, responding in part to the Miller majority. At length, citing from histories of the era, he argued that, at the time of the country's founding, writers like Benjamin Franklin and John Cleland had enjoyed far greater freedom to write about sexual topics than even current law now allowed. The rights granted by Stanley were useless, he said, if one could not freely obtain the materials to read or view in the home. In a separate dissent, William Brennan said Section 1305 was overbroad and unconstitutional.
Majority
Burger recounted the facts of the case, and he then turned to the Stanley argument. "But it is now well established that obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment", he wrote, referring to the Court's other holdings that day. Stanley he continued, was fundamentally a case about privacy and the Fourth Amendment rather than free speech and the First.Reels of Film, 413 U.S. at 126.
Courts should avoid granting inferential, incremental steps like these, Burger cautioned, in one of the most frequently quoted sections of the case:
It did not matter that, unlike the claimant in Thirty-seven Photographs, Paladini insisted that the materials were for private personal use. "To allow such a claim would be not unlike compelling the Government to permit importation of prohibited or controlled drugs for private consumption as long as such drugs are not for public distribution or sale." In one of the other cases, United States v. Orito,United States v. Orito, . the Court had upheld federal law prohibiting obscenity from being sent through domestic cargo shippers, paralleling its decision of two years earlier in Thirty-seven Photographs's companion case United States v. Reidel, which affirmed the prohibition on sending obscenity through the mail. Congress could, Burger admitted, allow the transmission and import of such materials with appropriate security measures to prevent unwilling recipients or children from being exposed to them, two legitimate state interests Stanley had recognized.Stanley, 394 U.S. at 567. But it had not.Reels of Film, 413 U.S. at 128–9.
Having dealt with the major issue, Burger added an afterthought, observing "that it is extremely difficult to control the uses to which obscene material is put once it enters this country" since it was by then technologically possible to make many copies very quickly and cheaply of a single original. But, "[w]hile it is true that a large volume of obscene material on microfilm could rather easily be smuggled into the United States by mail, or otherwise, and could be enlarged or reproduced for commercial purposes, Congress is not precluded from barring some avenues of illegal importation because avenues exist that are more difficult to regulate."Reels of Film, 413 U.S. at 129.
Dissents
"I know of no constitutional way by which a book, tract, paper, postcard, or film may be made contraband because of its contents", Douglas began, reiterating the opposition to obscenity laws he had stated in many opinions over the preceding years. "The Constitution never purported to give the Federal Government censorship or oversight over literature or artistic productions, save as they might be governed by the Patent and Copyright Clause ..."Reels of Film, 413 U.S. at 130., Douglas, J., dissenting.
Justice Douglas responded to the Miller majority's argument that the First Amendment necessarily incorporated the common-law strictures on obscenity that existed at that time. James Madison, in drafting the Bill of Rights, intended for them to apply strictly to the federal government.After the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted following the Civil War, the Bill of Rights was held to apply to the states as well. "Tying censorship to the movement of literature or films in interstate commerce or into foreign commerce would have been an easy way for a government of delegated powers to impair the liberty of expression. It was to bar such suppression that we have the First Amendment. I daresay Jefferson and Madison would be appalled at what the Court espouses today."Reels of Film, 413 U.S. at 132.
Histories of the era, Douglas wrote, show that at the time of the Constitution's adoption many sexually frank works such as Fanny Hill circulated widely, with little censorship or prosecution."Reels of Film, 413 U.S. at 132–4. In Bridges v. California, a 1941 decision overturning the contempt conviction of a labor leader for publishing a telegram from a state official, the Court had itself quoted Madison to the effect that the Revolution specifically intended to replace English common law on freedom of speech and the press, since the Magna Carta said nothing about them.Bridges v. California, , 263–265., Black, J. And the Court's own recent efforts to define obscenity "have not been productive of meaningful standards ... The reason is not the inability or mediocrity of judges".Reels of Film, 413 U.S. at 136–7.
"[I]t is ironic to me," Douglas concluded, "that, in this Nation, many pages must be written and many hours spent to explain why a person who can read whatever he desires ... may not without violating a law carry that literature in his briefcase or bring it home from abroad. Unless there is that ancillary right, one's Stanley rights could be realized, as has been suggested, only if one wrote or designed a tract in his attic and printed or processed it in his basement, so as to be able to read it in his study."Reels of Film, 413 U.S. at 137.Douglas was referring to Black's suggestion as such in his Thirty-seven Photographs dissent, 402 U.S. at 382.
Brennan's short dissent reflected the change in his thinking about obscenity. It alluded to his dissent in another of the companion cases, Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, in which he said he no longer believed it was reasonably possible for judges to define obscenity, even narrowly.Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, , 84, (1973), Brennan, J., dissenting. For that reason, he considered any statute that attempted to do so, or suppressed obscenity based on that definition, as overbroad and unconstitutional on its face.Reels of Film, 413 U.S. at 138, Brennan, J., dissenting.
Subsequent jurisprudence
The Court's clear holding that the privately possessed obscene material did not create the right to distribute it became part of its general body on the subject. In the wake of Miller, that has not had to be revisited, since general obscenity prosecutions declined, technology allowed more discreet methods of obtaining pornography, and the Court has not had to reconsider its standard. Enforcement mostly turned to child pornography, the production and distribution of which Congress banned with the Child Protection Act of 1978. Four years later, the Court held that obscene material depicting actual children was not protected speech in New York v. Ferber in 1982.New York v. Ferber, .
Until that statute was further revised in 1984, possession of child pornography was still legal.The Court upheld possession bans in Osborne v. Ohio, . An Oregon man appealed his 1983 conviction, for receiving sexually explicit films with underage teenagers in the mail from Sweden, and asked the Ninth Circuit to reject the Reels of Film holding. It instead relied on it in upholding the conviction, telling the appellee to take it up with the Supreme Court.United States v. Hurt, 795 F.2d 765, 771 (9th Cir., 1986)
Justice Antonin Scalia, who replaced Burger in 1986, twice approvingly quoted the chief justice's warning in Reels of Film about the dangers of incremental judicial expansion of a statutory construction. In NLRB v. Electrical Workers, upholding union disciplinary action against members who had worked for a nonunion employer, decided in Scalia's first term, he cited Burger in his concurrence, explaining his textualist approach to jurisprudence, calling it "nowhere more applicable".NLRB v. Electrical Workers, , 598 (1987), Scalia, J., concurring. Almost two decades later, dissenting in Tennessee v. Lane, Scalia repeated the entire passage again.''Tennessee v. Lane, , 565, (2004), Scalia, J., dissenting.

From "United States v. 50 Acres of Land" ==> """
United States v. 50 Acres of Land, 469 U.S. 24 (1985), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding whether a public condemnee is entitled to consequential damages measured by the cost of acquiring a substitute facility if it has a duty to replace the condemned facility. The Court declined to award the costs of the substitute facility, holding that the Fifth Amendment does not require consequential damages when the market value of the condemned property is ascertainable and when there is no showing of manifest injustice..
Background
In 1978, as part of a flood control project, the United States condemned approximately  of land owned by the city of Duncanville, Texas. The site had been used since 1969 as a sanitary landfill. In order to replace the condemned landfill, the city acquired a  site and developed it into a larger and better facility. In the condemnation proceedings, the city claimed that it was entitled to recover all of the costs incurred in acquiring the substitute site and developing it as a landfill, an amount in excess of $1,276,000. The United States, however, contended that proper compensation should be determined by the fair market value of the condemned facility and deposited $199,950 in the registry of the court as its estimation of the amount due.
Before trial the Government filed a motion in limine to exclude any evidence of the cost of the substitute facility, arguing that it was not relevant to the calculation of fair market value. The District Court denied the motion, noting that the Supreme Court had left open the question of the proper measure of compensation for the condemnation of public property. The court concluded that "a complete factual record should be developed from which an independent determination of the appropriate measure of compensation can be made."50 Acres of Land, 469 U.S. at 27.
Procedural history
At trial, both parties submitted evidence on the fair market value of the condemned property and on the cost of the substitute landfill facility. Responding to special interrogatories, the jury found that the fair market value of the condemned property was $225,000, and that the reasonable cost of a substitute facility was $723,624.01. The District Court entered judgment for the lower amount plus interest on the difference between that amount and the sum already paid. The District Court explained that the city had not met its "burden of establishing what would be a reasonable cost of a substitute facility."50 Acres of Land, 529 F. Supp. at 221. In addition, the court was of the view that "substitute facilities compensation should not be awarded in every case where a public condemnee can establish a duty to replace the condemned property, at least where a fair market value can be established."50 Acres of Land, 529 F. Supp. at 222.
The court found no basis for departing from the market value standard in this case, and reasoned that the application of the substitute facilities measure of compensation would necessarily provide the city with a "windfall."
The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for further proceedings. It reasoned that the city's loss attributable to the condemnation was "the amount of money reasonably spent . . . to create a functionally equivalent facility."50 Acres of Land, 706 F.2d at 1360. If the city was required, either as a matter of law or as a matter of practical necessity, to replace the old landfill facility, the Court of Appeals believed that it would receive no windfall.
Opinion of the Court
The Court held that the Fifth Amendment does not require that the United States pay a public condemnee compensation measured by the cost of acquiring a substitute facility that the condemnee has a duty to acquire, when the market value of the condemned property is ascertainable and when there is no showing of manifest injustice. Rather, "Just compensation" under the Fifth Amendment normally is to be measured by the market value of the property at the time of the taking, and this case is not one in which an exception is required because fair market value is not ascertainable. The testimony at trial established that there was a fairly robust market for sanitary landfill properties. The Court did also not believe that an award of compensation measured by market value here to be fundamentally inconsistent with the basic principles of indemnity embodied in the Just Compensation Clause.
In addition, the Court held that the text of the Fifth Amendment does not mandate a more favorable rule of compensation for public condemnees than for private parties. The reference to "private property" in the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment encompasses the property of state and local governments when it is condemned by the United States, and under this construction the same principles of just compensation presumptively apply to both private and public condemnees.

From "United States v. 422 Casks of Wine" ==> """
United States v. 422 Casks of Wine, 26 U.S. (1 Pet.) 547 (1828), is an 1828 United States Supreme Court civil forfeiture case between the United States and 422 casks of Malaga wine.. The case was brought after the United States moved to seize the wine on the grounds that it had been deliberately mislabeled as sherry to get a tax drawback, and the buyers objected. The original trial was ruled in favor of the United States but was ordered to be retried after errors were discovered concerning jurisdiction. In the subsequent retrial, the Supreme Court ruled against the United States; however, they did grant them a certificate of seizure on probable cause.
The defendant in this case was an object rather than a person, making this a jurisdiction in rem case, power over objects, rather than the more familiar in personam case over persons.
 Background 
The 422 casks of Malaga wine were imported into the United States via New York State as a false entry before being moved to New Orleans. The wine was seized, as it had been mislabeled as sherry and was being used to falsely claim a tax drawback in 1819.. The seizure was challenged by Hazard and Williams, who were to purchase the wines from Charles Hall.
The case was first heard as "The Sarah", named after the ship on which the wine was seized. During the proceedings at the District Court of Louisiana, it was revealed that the wine was seized on land rather than on the sea, so the United States moved for a jury trial. The jury found for the United States, with the judge issuing a sentence of condemnation against the wine. The appellants for the wine appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that there had been irregularities in the proceedings, as it had started as an Admiralty court case but then was treated as an Exchequer court  case under the Judiciary Act of 1789 and should not have been a jury trial. The District Attorney argued that there was nothing stopping an Admiralty court from calling for a jury trial, citing the judices selecti of the Roman Empire. In 1823, the Supreme Court found that there were irregularities; when the court found that the wine was seized on land, the judge should have stopped the trial, as he had no jurisdiction. As such, the Supreme Court annulled the seizure order and remitted the case back to the District Court for retrial.
 Case 
Upon the District Attorney amending the complaint to an Exchequer case, the jury in this case found in favor of the wines. The Attorney-General of the United States appealed the decision to the Supreme Court on the grounds of asking for a Writ of Error in that Hall, the real owner, had not expressed opposition to the seizure. Hazard and Williams argued as the buyers, they had legal title to the wine. Justice Story delivered the verdict. He stated that because Hazard and Williams had proved they had a proprietary interest in the wine, they were legally entitled to challenge the seizure even if they were not the real owners. The court also held that while the mislabeling may have been fraudulent, it did not mean that the transfer of ownership was automatically void unless the claimants stated so. The court found there had been no error and affirmed the jury's decision in favor of the wine; however, it did grant the United States a certificate of probable cause of seizure as the cause for seizure affirmed in the original jury verdict had not been denied. The case was returned to the District Court to either return the wine to the claimants or proceed with the seizure under the certificate. The case is cited as legal precedent for in rem cases where the claimant must put their claims on oath or the other party can insist on dismissal.

From "United States v. Adams" ==> """
United States v. Adams, 383 U.S. 39 (1966), is a United States Supreme Court decision in the area of patent law.. This case was later cited in KSR v. Teleflex as an example of a case satisfying the requirement for non-obviousness of a combination of known elements.  It also features one of the great stories of patent litigation lore, with Adams's attorney utilizing an innovative and unique method of non-oral advocacy at oral argument in front of the Supreme Court.
 Background 
This case was a companion case to Graham v. John Deere, decided on the same day. The United States sought review of a judgment of the Court of Claims, holding valid and infringed a patent on a wet battery issued to Adams.
The suit was brought by Adams and others holding an interest in the patent against the Government charging the Government with infringement and breach of an implied contract. The Government challenged the validity of the patent and denied that it had been infringed or that any contract for its use had ever existed.
The Trial Commissioner held that the patent was valid and infringed in part but that no contract, express or implied, had been established. The United States sought certiorari on the patent validity issue only.  
The patent under consideration, U.S. No. 2,322,210, relates to a nonrechargeable electrical battery composed of two electrodes - one of magnesium and the other of cuprous chloride, with a plain or salt water electrolyte.
The specifications of the patent states that the object of the invention is to provide constant voltage and current without the use of acids and without the generation of dangerous fumes. Another object was to provide a battery which may be manufactured and distributed in a dry condition and rendered serviceable by filling the container with water.  Adams did not, however, claim this important distinguishing factor of his invention.
For several years prior to filing, Adams worked in his home experimenting on the development of a wet battery. He found that when cuprous chloride and magnesium were used in either plain water or salt water, an improved battery resulted.
Less than a month after filing, Adams brought his discovery to the attention of the Army and Navy. Arrangements were made for demonstrations before experts of the United States Army Signal Corps. The Signal Corps scientists did not believe the battery was workable. In particular, a government expert with the National Bureau of Standards felt that Adams was making unusually large claims that were not convincing.
Later, the Government entered into contracts with various manufacturers to produce the battery and did not notify or seek permission from Adams.
The basic idea of chemical generation of electricity was old, tracing back to the epic discovery by Italian scientist Alessandro Volta in 1795, who found that when two dissimilar metals are placed in an electrically conductive fluid an electromotive force is set up and electricity generated. The basic elements of a chemical battery are a pair of electrodes of different electrochemical properties and a liquid or moist paste electrolyte. Various materials may be employed as electrodes, various electrolyte are possible and many combinations of these elements have been the object of considerable experimentation.
The United States challenged the validity of the Adams patent on the ground of lack of novelty as well as obviousness.
The Government argued that wet batteries comprising a zinc anode and silver chloride cathode were old in the art; and that the prior art showed that magnesium could be substituted for zinc and cuprous chloride for silver chloride.
 Opinion of the Court 
The Court noted several errors in the Government's position. First, the Adam's battery was water-activated, which set his device apart from the prior art, even though "water-activated" was not cited in the claims.  In fact, this feature plays the central role in one of the great stories of patent litigation lore:  Adams's attorney arose before the Supreme Court, took a drink from his glass of water, and then dropped a tiny Adams battery into the glass.  The inventive battery immediately lit a tiny light that continued to burn throughout the argument.  Some accounts suggest that the attorney knew he had won the case when the Justices kept their eyes on the tiny burning light throughout the remainder of the argument.Adelman, et al., Patent Law: In A Nutshell 163 (2008).
"Despite the fact that each of the elements of the Adams battery was well known in the prior art....  [K]nown disadvantages in old devices which would naturally discourage the search for new inventions may be taken into account in determining obviousness."
The Supreme Court's Adams opinion invokes several secondary considerations in favor of nonobviousness.  In particular, the Court observed that the record disclosed the skepticism of experts before the invention, the endorsement of experts after disclosure, and unexpected results.  In a case that featured a great deal of prior art very close to the invention, these secondary considerations evidently played an important, perhaps even dispositive, role.

From "United States v. Alvarez" ==> """
United States v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. 709 (2012), is a landmark decision in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 was unconstitutional. The Stolen Valor Act of 2005 was a federal law that criminalized false statements about having a military medal. It had been passed by Congress as an effort to stem instances where people falsely claimed to have earned the medal in an attempt to protect the valor of legitimate recipients. A 6–3 majority of the Supreme Court agreed that the law was unconstitutional and violated the free speech protections under the First Amendment. Despite reaffirming the opinion that was previously issued by the Ninth Circuit, it could not agree on a single rationale. Four justices concluded that a statement's falsity is not enough, by itself, to exclude speech from First Amendment protection. Another two justices concluded that while false statements were entitled to some protection, the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 was invalid because it could have achieved its objectives in less restrictive ways.
Veterans organizations and politicians reacted negatively. Several months after the decision, both chambers of Congress passed new versions of the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 based on the suggestions in the Court's opinion. Despite the Supreme Court having struck down the conviction under the Act, Alvarez remained in prison for fraud on other matters.
Background
Stolen Valor Act of 2005
President George W. Bush signed the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 (18 U.S.C. § 704) into law on December 20, 2006. The Act broadens previous provisions addressing the unauthorized wear, manufacture, or sale of any military decorations and medals by making it a misdemeanor to falsely represent oneself as having received any U.S. military decoration or medal. If convicted, defendants may be imprisoned for up to six months, unless the decoration lied about is the Medal of Honor, in which case imprisonment could be up to one year. Proponents in Congress argued that the law was passed to prevent imposters from "stealing the valor" of soldiers returning from engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Alvarez's statements
In 2007, at a Three Valley Water District Board meeting in Claremont, California, new member Xavier Alvarez introduced himself by saying, "I'm a retired Marine of 25 years. I retired in the year 2001. Back in 1987, I was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. I got wounded many times by the same guy."617 F. 3d 1198, 1201–1202 (CA9 2010).
As this statement was not true, Alvarez was indicted for violating the Stolen Valor Act of 2005. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, the place where the trial was to occur, rejected Alvarez's claim that the act was unconstitutional. This decision was reversed by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which held the law invalid.617 F. 3d 1218 (CA9 2010).
The government appealed the Ninth Circuit's decision, which was subsequently granted by the Supreme Court in 2011.
Supreme Court oral arguments
The Supreme Court heard oral argument on February 22, 2012. Donald Verrilli, Jr., Solicitor General of the United States, appeared on behalf of the United States. Jonathan D. Libby, Deputy Federal Public Defender, appeared on behalf of Alvarez.
Verrilli spoke first; he began by explaining that military honors touch on the core values of the armed forces, and the Stolen Valor Act simply aims to protect those core values. Almost immediately Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Verrilli a hypothetical:
 Verrilli responded by suggesting that such an act would be covered by the Act only if it were "reasonably understood by the audience as a statement of fact or as an exercise in political theater."
The questions during Verrilli's argument focused on the lack of injury caused by false claims of military honors.Id. at 5 . In nearly all the cases that the United States cited to support the proposition that there is no First Amendment value in falsity, the Court had addressed a false statement that harmed another, such as a defamatory statement. Relying on these cases, Verrilli stated, "[T]his Court has said in numerous contexts, numerous contexts, that the calculated factual falsehood has no First Amendment value for its own sake."Id. at 4–5 . Justice Anthony Kennedy immediately retorted:
Libby opened the defense argument by emphasizing that the First Amendment is intended to protect personal autonomy. In response to several questions, Libby played on the Court's discontent with the apparent lack of harm by stating that there is value in falsity "so long as it doesn't cause imminent harm to another person or imminent harm to a government function."Id. at 27 .
Libby stumbled in the Court's estimation, however, when he conceded that the Act did not chill any truthful speech. In response, Justice Kagan stated, "So, boy, I mean, that's a big concession, Mr. Libby. Then you're saying, you can only win this case if this Court decides that the Gertz statement was a kind of overstatement, an exaggeration, puffery."Id. at 36–37 .
Supreme Court's decision
On June 28, 2012, a divided Court held that the prohibition against making false statements of having been awarded a military medal under the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 violated the First Amendment. However, the six justices in the majority could not agree on a single rationale for the decision. Since the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 did not contain a provision of severability, the Supreme Court was ultimately free to overturn the Act in its entirety. 
Kennedy's plurality opinion
Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a plurality consisting of himself, Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, wrote that false statements are not, by the sole reason of their falsity, excluded from First Amendment protection. "The Court has never endorsed the categorical rule the Government advances," Kennedy wrote. "Our prior decisions have not confronted a measure, like the Stolen Valor Act [of 2005], that targets falsity and nothing more." Even though there are several examples of the use of penalizing false speech (like perjury), Kennedy argued that "[t]he Government has not demonstrated that false statements generally should constitute a new category of unprotected speech..."
The plurality opinion also expressed the wide applicability of the Stolen Valor Act of 2005. "The Act by its plain terms," Kennedy wrote, "applies to a false statement made at any time, in any place, to any person". Such breadth means that the law is "sweeping... [the] reach of the statute puts it in conflict with the First Amendment... the statute would apply with equal force to personal, whispered conversations within a home."
When balanced against the Government's need to protect the value of the medal, the plurality said that "the link between the Government's interest in protecting the integrity of the military honors system and the Act's restriction on the false claims of liars like respondent has not been shown." Additionally, Kennedy wrote that 'counter-speech' was a sufficient solution to the problem: "It is a fair assumption that any true holders of the Medal who had heard of Alvarez's false claims would have been fully vindicated by the community's expression of outrage... Truth needs neither handcuffs nor a badge for its vindication."
Wrote Kennedy: "Permitting the government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense, whether shouted from the rooftops or made in a barely audible whisper, would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects about which false statements are punishable. That governmental power has no clear limiting principle. Our constitutional tradition stands against the idea that we need Oceania’s Ministry of Truth," invoking George Orwell's novel 1984.
Breyer's concurrence
Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justice Elena Kagan, agreed that the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 was unconstitutional, but on entirely different grounds. Breyer based his finding not on a strict scrutiny test that the plurality had used, but on a "proportionality" or "intermediate scrutiny test". This test examines "whether the statute works speech-related harm that is out of proportion to its justifications." After holding that Congress could create a database of those who had won the medal, among other alternatives to the existing law, Breyer said that there were lesser restrictive means to achieve the government's interest.
Alito's dissent
Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, dissented from the Court's decision striking down the Act. For Alito, the ruling had "[broken] sharply from a long line of cases recognizing that the right to free speech does not protect false factual statements that inflict real harm and serve no legitimate interest." "The Stolen Valor Act [of 2005]," Alito wrote, "represents the judgment of the people's elected representatives that false statements about military awards are very different from false statements about civilian awards... [the Act] is a narrow law enacted to address an important problem, and it presents no threat to freedom of expression."
Subsequent developments
Reaction
The decision received praise on constitutional grounds from across the political spectrum. The First Amendment Center called the decision "a victory for free speech and common sense."
Several veterans organizations leaders were dismayed by the decision. A spokesperson for the Veterans of Foreign Wars said "Despite the ruling, the VFW will continue to challenge far-fetched stories, and to publicize these false heroes to the broadest extent possible as a deterrent to others.” Harold A. Fritz, a recipient of the medal from the Vietnam War, agreed with the VFW that "It’s more than just a piece of metal suspended on a piece of cloth on a pin. . . . And people who abuse that . . . need to be penalized." Proponents of the Stolen Valor Act promised to bring forward more limited legislation in the future.
The American Legion expressed hope that a narrower law would survive constitutional scrutiny.  "We felt good about portions of the decision which suggest that a more narrowly tailored bill which incorporates traditional fraud elements would be upheld," said Fang Wong, national commander of the American Legion.
Alvarez's attorney praised the decision, saying "The First Amendment protects a lot of what we as Americans get to say...The government doesn't get to decide what we can and cannot say.”
Aftermath
Alvarez remained in legal trouble due to allegations that he defrauded the government by falsely receiving health insurance benefits. He was convicted of misappropriation of public funds, grand theft, and insurance fraud in 2009 and sentenced to five years in state prison, and was discharged in March 2012 from Calipatria State Prison.
Revised Law
In 2012, an effort was initiated to revise the Stolen Valor Act of 2005 to comply with the decision from the Supreme Court. The result was the Stolen Valor Act of 2013. This revised version of the law was passed by Congress and it was eventually signed by President Barack Obama. In addition to a wrongful claim of receiving one of the listed military awards, intent to gain some benefit or something of value by fraud was required.

From "United States v. Alvarez-Machain" ==> """
United States v. Alvarez-Machain, 504 U.S. 655 (1992), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the respondent's forcible abduction from a foreign country, despite the existence of an extradition treaty with said country, does not prohibit him from being tried before a U.S. court for violations of American criminal laws. The ruling reconfirmed the Ker-Frisbie Doctrine, established in Ker v. Illinois (1886) and Frisbie v. Collins (1952), which generally permits the prosecution of criminal defendants regardless of whether their presence was obtained in accordance with an applicable extradition treaty.
Background
Humberto Álvarez Machaín, a Mexican physician, was allegedly involved in the 1985 kidnapping, torture, and murder of Enrique Camarena Salazar, an American citizen employed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, by "prolonging [his] life so that others could further torture and interrogate him."
On April 2, 1990, Álvarez was abducted from Mexico by Trent Tompkins, a U.S. citizen hired by DEA agents, and brought to trial in the United States over the protest of Mexican officials.Mark S. Zaid: Military might versus sovereign right – the kidnapping of Dr. Humberto Alvarez-Machain and the resulting fallout. Houston Journal of International Law, spring 1997, cited at Findarticles.com and there retrieved April 3, 2011 
Legal action reached the Supreme Court, focusing upon the effect of illegal extradition upon the trial court's jurisdiction. Invoking the "Ker–Frisbie doctrine" the Court held that the trial court's jurisdiction was not affected by the manner in which the accused was brought before it. This created international alarm and concern as other nations feared that the decision would encourage further such abductions.
 Aftermath 
Despite vigorous protests from the Mexican government, Álvarez was tried in United States District Court in Los Angeles; the trial, in which his defense focused intensely on the legality of the arrest, resulted in an acquittal. The trial judge (whose earlier decision dismissing the indictment had been overruled by the Supreme Court) ruled at the close of the government's case in chief that the government had not presented a prima facie case, and therefore granted an acquittal without presenting the matter to the jury for verdict.  The other suspect, Javier Vasquez Velasco, was arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder, convicted, and sentenced to three life sentences.

From "United States v. American Bell Telephone Co." ==> """
United States v. Bell Telephone Co., 167 U.S. 224 (1897), is an 1897 decision of the United States Supreme Court that held that the United States lacked standing to challenge the validity of its issued patents “on the mere ground of error of judgment” in issuing them..  The United States had standing to seek to invalidate patents, however, on grounds of fraudulent procurement and also as a defense to a charge of patent infringement. The decision operated for many decades as a bar to government efforts to seek invalidation of patents that it considered spurious until the Supreme Court limited Bell Telephone, first to a limited extent in United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,. and then more broadly in United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd..
Background
On February 1, 1893, the United States filed in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts a bill in equity against the American Bell Telephone Company and Emile Berliner, praying a decree to set aside and cancel U.S. patent No. 463,569, issued on November 17, 1891, to Bell as assignee of the inventor Berliner. According to the opinion in the case:
The application by Berliner was made on June 4, 1877, he having filed a caveat on April 14, 1877. In 1878, and prior to October 23, the telephone company purchased Berliner's invention, and on November 17, 1891, a patent was issued to the telephone company, as assignee of Berliner. The application was therefore pending in the department fourteen years, during thirteen of which the invention was the property of the telephone company.Bell Telephone Co., 167 U.S. at 243.
The government made two allegations on which the circuit court passed:
1. Bell delayed the patent application in the patent office for thirteen years. That was, under the circumstances alleged in the bill, unlawful and fraudulent. According to the government, this enabled Bell to enjoy a monopoly on the telephone because of Alexander Graham Bell's patent, and then when it expired an additional monopoly under Berliner's, thus prolonging the period of monopoly over the telephone. "So that, while the public has today, by reason of the expiration of the Bell patent, the right to use as it pleases his invention, such right is a barren one, and the telephone monopoly is practically extended to the termination of the Berliner patent, and this extension of the time of the monopoly has been accomplished by means of the delay in the issue of the Berliner patent—the long pendency of the application in the Patent Office."
2. Bell received two patents, one in 1880 and another in 1891, upon a division of the original application. Both patents cover the same invention so that Bell got two patents on the same invention, one of which expires eleven years after the other one. The patent commissioner did not have legal power to issue more than one patent on one invention.
Upon amended pleadings and proofs, the circuit court on January 3, 1895, 65 F. 86, entered a decree as prayed for in favor of the United States. On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, this decree was on May 18, 1895, reversed, and a decree entered directing a dismissal of the bill. 68 F. 542. Thereupon the United States took an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Ruling of the Supreme Court
The Court's majority opinion, by Justice Brewer, began by noting that this was the first case by the United States "to set aside a patent for an invention as wrongfully issued."167 U. S. 237-38. There were prior cases as to land patents, however, and the Court looked to them for guidance. 
These cases required "clear, convincing, and unambiguous" evidence from the government to overcome "the presumption that all the preceding steps required by the law had been observed before its issue, [given] the immense importance and necessity of the stability of titles dependent upon these official instruments."167 U.S. at 241.
Applying this principle to the government's first argument, the Court asked what caused the thirteen years of delay—"It may have been caused either by the negligent or wrongful action of the officers of the department, and without any connivance, assistance, or concurrence on the part of the applicant, or it may have been brought about by the applicant, either through its corruption of the public officers or through other misconduct on its part."167 U.S. at 250-51. The Court said that the burden was on the government to prove bribery or other misconduct to cause delay, and no evidence of that was in the record. The government's only evidence was of "the supine submission of the company to such extraordinary delay."167 U.S. at 254. The Court said that the patent officials could have acted more expeditiously, but there is no evidence that "they acted wrongfully, and [that] their action was induced by or at the instance of the defendants."167 U.S. at 261. Therefore, the government's first argument failed.
As for the second argument—double patenting—the Court said the patent office had made a determination on that point that "was adverse to the [present] contention of the government, and such judgment cannot be reviewed in this suit."167 U.S. at 264. The reason was the government lacked standing to litigate that issue:
[W]hen it has no proprietary or pecuniary result in the setting aside of the patent, is not seeking to discharge its obligations to the public, when it has brought the suit simply to help an individual, making itself, as it were, the instrument by which the right of that individual against the patentee can be established—then it becomes subject to the rules governing like suits between private litigants.167 U.S. at 265.
To be sure: "Doubtless the removal from the public of the burden of a monopoly charged to have been wrongfully created was also one of the objects, and perhaps the principal object."167 U.S. at 266. But the patent law gives the patent office exclusive power to determine whether to issue a patent. "[T]he argument is a forcible one that such determination[s] should be held conclusive upon the government."167 U.S. at 268. The United States may sue to cancel a patent procured by fraud, but this is not such a case. "Least of all was it intended . . . that the courts of the United States, sitting as courts of equity, could entertain jurisdiction of a suit by the United States to set aside a patent for an invention on the mere ground of error of judgment on the part of the patent officials."167 U.S. at 260.
Justice Harlan dissented without opinion.
Later developments
In United States v. United States Gypsum Co., the Supreme Court recognized that Bell Telephone held that the United States was "without standing to bring a suit in equity to cancel a patent on the ground of invalidity," but went on to declare that, to vindicate the public interest in enjoining violations of the Sherman Act, the United States is entitled to attack the validity of patents relied upon to justify anticompetitive conduct otherwise violative of the law.United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. at 387. Specifically, if a patentee defended price-fixing on the ground that it was permissible under the 1926 General Electric case, the government could overcome that defense by showing the patent was invalid.
In United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., the government showed that the defendants used their patent power to secure restrictive patent licenses that violated the antitrust laws. Then, the government sought a declaration that the patents were invalid and as relief compulsory licensing of the patents and mandatory sales of the patented product, on reasonable terms. The district court refused the relief, accepting the defendants' arguments that the government would "deny defendants an essential ingredient of their rights under the patent system," and that there was no warrant for "such a drastic forfeiture of their rights." The district court cited Bell Telephone as authority for the government's lack of standing to challenge patent validity. The Supreme Court reversed. Whether the patents were valid or invalid could significantly affect what remedies were appropriate. It held:
In this context, where the court would necessarily be dealing with the future enforceability of the patents, we think it would have been appropriate, if it appeared that the Government's claims for further relief were substantial, for the court to have also entertained the Government's challenge to the validity of those patents.Glaxo Group, 410 U.S. at 59.

From "United States v. American Library Ass'n" ==> """
United States v. American Library Association, 539 U.S. 194 (2003), was a decision in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that the United States Congress has the authority to require public schools and libraries receiving E-Rate discounts to install web filtering software as a condition of receiving federal funding. In a plurality opinion, the Supreme Court ruled that public school and library usage of Internet filtering software does not violate their patrons' First Amendment free speech rights and that the Children's Internet Protection Act is not unconstitutional..
Background
The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) was passed by Congress in 2000. CIPA was Congress's third attempt to regulate obscenity on the Internet, but the first two (the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and the Child Online Protection Act of 1998) were struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional free speech restrictions, largely due to vagueness and overbreadth issues that caused those statutes to fail the strict scrutiny test..Ashcroft v. Am. Civil Liberties Union, . 
CIPA required that in order to qualify for federal assistance for Internet access, public schools and libraries must install software that blocked images deemed obscene, and other material which could be dangerous for minor children. CIPA imposed certain types of requirements on any school or library that receives funding under the E-rate program or Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) grants, which subsidize internet technology and connectivity for schools and libraries. In 2001 the Federal Communications Commission issued rules implementing CIPA.  
The American Library Association challenged this law, claiming that it improperly required them to restrict the First Amendment rights of consenting library patrons. The case originated in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which ruled that CIPA was unconstitutional because it restricted speech in a public forum (a school or library), and issued an injunction to prevent the statute from being enforced.American Library Ass'n v. United States, 201 F.Supp.2d 401 (E.D. Pa., 2002). The U.S. government appealed that decision directly to the Supreme Court, due to a provision in the statute that  permitted appeals to be heard directly by the Supreme Court without the usual intermediate appellate decision. 
The Supreme Court considered whether public libraries' use of Internet filtering software violated patrons' First Amendment rights, as well as whether CIPA was a valid exercise of Congress' spending power by requiring filters for any library who wanted to receive federal funds for Internet access.
Opinion of the Court
In a plurality decision written by Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Supreme Court reversed the District Court's decision, and upheld the constitutionality of the Children's Internet Protection Act. The court held that CIPA only required libraries to install software filters but not to require all patrons to use them, while patrons could also request that the filters be disabled. Thus, filters were not unacceptably restrictive.   
The Supreme Court also held that the public forum principles on which the district court relied were "out of place in the context of this case" and that Internet access in public libraries "is neither a 'traditional' nor a 'designated' public forum" under the established public forum law. A library does not acquire Internet terminals in order to "create a public forum for Web publishers to express themselves, any more than it collects books in order to provide a public forum for the authors of books to speak." The Court explained that the Internet is simply "another method for making information available in a school or library... [and is] no more than a technological extension of the book stack."
 Dissenting opinions 
Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, submitting that CIPA unlawfully conditioned receipt of government funding on the restriction of First Amendment rights, because CIPA denied the libraries any discretion in judging the merits of the blocked websites. 
Justice David Souter also dissented, arguing that CIPA was not narrowly tailored to achieve the government's legitimate interest in restricting harmful Internet content. He focused on the language of CIPA which said the library "may" unblock the filters for "bona fide research or other lawful purposes", which imposed eligibility on unblocking and left it up to the librarians discretion. He believed this would prevent adults from accessing lawful and constitutionally protected speech. He suggested that to prevent this, children could be restricted to blocked terminals, leaving unblocked terminals available to adults. He believed CIPA to be an unconstitutional "content-based restriction on communication of material in the library's control that an adult could otherwise lawfully see" rising to the level of censorship.
Impact
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that it was "disappointed" that the Supreme Court held that Congress can force public libraries to install blocking software on library Internet terminals, but noted that the ruling minimized the law's impact on adults, who can insist that the software be disabled.  Chris Hansen, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU, also stated that "'Although we are disappointed that the Court upheld a law that is unequivocally a form of censorship, there is a silver lining. The Justices essentially rewrote the law to minimize its effect on adult library patrons."
In 2016, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals ruled in Wisconsin v. David J. Reidinger that a library patron did not have a First Amendment right to view pornography in a public library, and if other patrons complain, such conduct could be considered a disturbance and subjected to a misdemeanor charge.

From "United States v. American Tobacco Co." ==> """
United States v. American Tobacco Company, , was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that the combination in this case is one in restraint of trade and an attempt to monopolize the business of tobacco in interstate commerce within the prohibitions of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. As a result, the American Tobacco Company was split into four competitors.
Facts
Judgment
The Sherman Antitrust Act was created in 1890, and in 1907 the American Tobacco Company was indicted in violation of it.Brandt, Alan M.: The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America, p. 39. Basic Books, 2007  In 1908 when the Department of Justice filed suit against the company, sixty-five companies and twenty-nine individuals were named in the suit.  The Supreme Court ordered the company to dissolve in 1911 on the same day that it ordered the Standard Oil Trust to dissolve.  The ruling in United States v. American Tobacco Co. stated that the combination of the tobacco companies "in and of itself, as well as each and all of the elements composing it whether corporate or individual, whether considered collectively or separately [was] in restraint of trade and an attempt to monopolize, and a monopolization within the first and second sections of the Anti-Trust Act."Jenkins, John Wilber: James B. Duke: Master Builder, p. 153. George H. Doran Company, 1927.
Significance
In order to promote market competition, four firms were created from the American Tobacco Company's assets: American Tobacco Company, R. J. Reynolds, Liggett & Myers, and Lorillard.  The monopoly became an oligopoly.
In 1938 Thurman Arnold in the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division began hosting hearings in the Temporary National Economic Committee to determine whether the four companies were further engaged together in monopolistic practices., citing  That committee found that 3 of the 4 companies were guilty of the charges presented to the court.

United States v. American Trucking Associations, 310 U.S. 534 (1940), was a landmark United States Supreme Court in which the court held the Motor Carrier Act of 1935 did not permit federal agencies to regulate employees whose duties did not affect safety and operation.United States v. American Trucking Ass'ns,  ("Our conclusion, in view of the circumstances set out in this opinion, is that the meaning of employees in § 204 (a) (1) and (2) is limited to those employees whose activities affect the safety of operation.").
Background
The American Trucking Associations (ATA) filed suit to compel the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to regulate all employees of trucking industries, rather than simply those whose job affects safety.American Trucking Ass'ns, 310 U.S. at 541.  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) included an exemption to employees regulated by the ICC under the Motor Carrier Act of 1935.  The ATA sought a ruling compelling the ICC to recognize all trucking employees as within its power to regulate, as such employees would then be exempt from the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA.
Opinion of the Court
The court decided that ICC's interpretation of the statute, which limited its power only to those employees who affect safety, was correct.American Trucking Ass'ns, 310 U.S. at 553.

United States v. Antelope, 430 U.S. 641 (1977), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that American Indians convicted on reservation land were not deprived of the equal protection of the laws; (a) the federal criminal statutes are not based on impermissible racial classifications but on political membership in an Indian tribe or nation; and (b) the challenged statutes do not violate equal protection.

Background
History of the Major Crime Act
In 1881, a Brulé-Lakota leader named Crow Dog shot and killed another Lakota leader, Spotted Tail on the Great Sioux Reservation in South Dakota.,  109 (1994); Jacqueline F. Langland, Indian Status Under the Major Crimes Act, 15  109, 114-15 (2012). In accordance with Lakota law and customs, the tribal council ordered an end to the hostilities and Crow Dog paid restitution to Spotted Tail's family in cash, a blanket, and eight horses., at 110; Langland, at 115. After apparent outrage from the white communities in the area, Crow Dog was tried in a federal district court and sentenced to hang.Langland, at 115.
Crow Dog appealed his conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court, and in Ex parte Crow DogEx parte Crow Dog, . the Court overturned the conviction, stating that it was not against federal law for one Indian to kill another Indian on reservation territory.Ex parte Crow Dog, 109 U.S. at 557; , at 129-30; Langland, at 115. Two years later, in 1885, Congress passed the Major Crimes Act,Major Crimes Act of 1885,  (codified as amended at ). making Indian on Indian crime a federal offense.Langland, at 115-16.
Antelope's crime
thumb|left|Map showing location of Coeur d'Alene reservation
In February 1974, Gabriel Francis Antelope, Leonard Francis Davison, William Andrew Davison, and Norbert Hillary Seyler broke into the home of 81-year-old Emma Teresa Johnson, burglarized the home and beat Johnson to death with their hands and feet.United States v. Antelope, ; United States v. Antelope, ; Survey of Washington Law: Criminal Law: Major Crimes Act—Felony Murder, 11  754, 776 (hereafter cited as Survey). All four were members of the Coeur d'Alene tribe and Johnson was a non-Indian living within the boundaries of the Coeur d'Alene Reservation.United States v. Antelope, .
Trial in federal court
Under the Major Crimes Act, the crimes committed by the four Indians were prosecuted by the United States Attorney instead of by the Kootenai County Prosecutor for the State of Idaho.Antelope, 523 F.2d at 402. During the trial in May 1974, Antelope and L. Davison were charged with felony murder, burglary, and robbery, while W.

Antelope argued that the federal statute did not require proof of premeditation while the state statute did require such proof for a murder conviction, and that the statute discriminated against Indians due to their race.Antelope, 523 F.2d at 402-03; Federal Court Overturns Indian Convictions, , Sept. 14, 1975, at 29 (via Newspapers.com ) (hereafter cited as Overturns). They contended that the federal statutes allowed the government to prosecute an Indian for killing a non-Indian on the reservation using a lesser standard for the offense, while a non-Indian who killed a non-Indian would be prosecuted by Idaho using a higher standard for the offense.Antelope, 523 F.2d at 402-03; Recent Developments, 3  509, 511 (1975); Overturns, at 29. The Ninth Circuit agreed, noting that there were four ways that a murder on the reservation could be tried and the three where one or more of the parties were Indian resulted in harsher punishment than had non-Indians only been involved.Survey, at 778. The court then reversed the murder convictions, ordering that they be tried under Idaho law.Antelope, 523 F.2d at 406-07; Overturns, at 29; Court to Rule, at 6.
Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Warren Burger delivered the opinion of a unanimous Court.Antelope, 430 U.S. at 642. Burger stated that "Federal regulation of Indian tribes, therefore, is governance of once-sovereign political communities; it is not to be viewed as legislation of a “ ‘racial’ group consisting of ‘Indians' . . . .”"Antelope, 430 U.S. at 646 (internal citations omitted). The Court did note that some lower courts had found Indian status without finding enrollment in a tribe being necessary, but did not address it since it was not applicable to the parties in this case.Clay R. Smith, Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom, 46- 18 (2003). Since the federal law was not racially motivated, it was not unconstitutional and the case was reversed and remanded.Antelope, 430 U.S. at 649; Overturns, at 29.
Subsequent developments
Court decisions
Antelope has raised additional questions. In the Eighth Circuit Court, Antelope has been used to support a finding that Indian blood quantum could be determinative of Indian status, not tribal membership or enrollment.United States v. Stymiest, ; Langland, at 122-23. On the other hand, the Ninth Circuit has held that the law "intentionally requires more than a simple blood test to determine whether someone is legally deemed an Indian."United States v. Cruz, . There, the Ninth Circuit required that the purported Indian actually be enrolled as a member of a tribe.Langland, at 124.
In United States v. Prentiss,United States v. Prentiss, , the government alleged that the victim of an arson was an Indian, but did not offer any proof that the victim had "Indian blood" or that the defendant lacked Indian blood.Prentiss, 273 F.3d at 1282-83; Smith, at 19 & 19 n.24. The Tenth Circuit Court rejected that position, holding that the current tests required some showing of Indian blood.Smith, at 19.
Scholarly debate
Disparate treatment condemned
The decision allows American Indians to be punished more harshly than a non-Indian who commits the same crime.,  137-38 (2012); L. Scott Gould, The Consent Paradigm: Tribal Sovereignty at the Millennium, 96  809, 855-57 (1996). Scholars have pointed out that the decision of the Supreme Court in Antelope and a predecessor case, Morton v. MancariMorton v. Mancari, . have "has led to disparate treatment of Indian defendants in multiple criminal contexts."Rachel Friedlander, Considering the Effects of Utilizing Uncounseled Tribal Convictions in Federal Recidivism Prosecutions, 16  955, 981 (2013). Others, such as former United States Attorney Troy Eid have said that "Native Americans living and working on Indian reservations must endure a separate but unequal justice system that discriminates perniciously against them solely based on race and ethnicity."Troy A. Eid & Carrie Covington Doyle, Separate but Unequal: The Federal Criminal Justice System in Indian Country, 81  1067, 1095 (2010). Some legal scholars opine that the Court's decision is wrong, noting that the first prong of a test for tribal membership is the race of the individual and that only after the racial prong is met does the political prong apply.Langland, at 110-11. 
It has been noted that if Indian were considered a race-based designation instead of a political designation, it would be unconstitutional.Kevin Meisner, Modern Problems of Criminal Jurisdiction in Indian Country, 17  175, 184 (1992).
Race-based treatment
Later cases, such as Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl,Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, . have apparently based the Court's decision on race instead of political alignment.Adoptive Couple, 133 S. Ct. at 2565 ("Such an interpretation would raise equal protection concerns. . . ."); Christopher Deluzio, Tribes and Race: The Court’s Missed Opportunity in Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, 34  509, 554 (2014). Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted this in her dissent, that "It is difficult to make sense of this suggestion [that a contrary result would create equal protection problems] in light of our precedents, which squarely hold that classifications based on Indian tribal membership are not impermissible racial classifications."Adoptive Couple, 133 S. Ct. at 2584 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting); Deluzio, at 555 (edits by Deluzio). Another article questions whether Antelope and Rogers would survive a case where a tribe enrolled a non-Indian as a member of that tribe, believing that such a challenge would result in the end of the "some Indian blood" requirement.Tommy Miller, Beyond Blood Quantum: The Legal and Political Implications of Expanding Tribal Enrollment, 3  323, 333 (2014).
Plenary power over Indians
Other scholars point to a series of cases, including Antelope, indicating that Congress has plenary power to regulate the Indians tribes as it sees fit.David C. Williams, The Borders of the Equal Protection Clause:Indians as Peoples, 38  759, 776 n.62 (1991).

From "United States v. Armstrong" ==> """
United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456 (1996), was a case heard by the Supreme Court of the United States.
Syllabus
Respondents filed a motion to dismiss their indictment for "crack" cocaine and other federal charges, alleging they were selected for prosecution based on their race. The motion was granted by the District Court and affirmed by the Ninth Circuit en banc, which ruled the proof requirements do not compel the defendant to demonstrate the Government has failed to prosecute others who are similarly situated.
The Supreme Court held that:
 Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, which governs discovery in criminal cases, exempts the work product of Government attorneys and agents made in connection with the case's investigation.
 Under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the decision whether to prosecute may not be based on an arbitrary classification such as race or religion. Thus a defendant must produce credible evidence that similarly situated defendants of other races could have been prosecuted, but were not, in order to be entitled to discovery.
The Supreme Court reversed and remanded, 8–1. Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the opinion of the court, and was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Stephen Breyer joined the majority opinion in part and also wrote a separate concurring opinion. Justice John P. Stevens wrote the dissenting opinion.

From "United States v. Arthrex, Inc." ==> """
United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. ___ (2021), was a United States Supreme Court case related to the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution as it related to patent judges on the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). In a complex decision, the Court ruled that these judges were considered "primary officers" under the Appointments Clause, normally subject to appointment through the US President and the US Senate, but to remedy the matter, the Court ruled that the constitutional issue is resolved by allowing the PTAB decisions to be subject to review by the appropriately-appointed Director of the Patent Office.
 Background 
The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act was passed by Congress in 2012 that significantly overhauled the United States patent system. Among features of the law, it enabled a new inter partes review of patents that could be initiated by nearly any member of the public. As this potentially would create more litigation within the United States Patent and Trademark Office, itself a division of the Department of Commerce, the Act established the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) which included administrative patent judges (APJs) appointed through the Commerce Secretary. An inter partes review of a patent is presented to three of the PTAB judges who make a final decision to keep or invalidate some or all of the patent. Any further challenge beyond this proceeds to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
In the specific case, Arthrex, Inc., a manufacturer of medical devices, had previously received a patent for a surgical device. They entered into a patent dispute with Smith & Nephew, Inc. and ArthroCare Corp., claiming the latter groups were infringing on their patent. The case moved into the PTAB, which found that Arthrex's patent was invalid. Arthrex appealed to the Federal Circuit, raising a question related to the constitutionality of the administrative judges on the PTAB. They argued that under the Appointments Clause, since the APJs were considered principal officers of the patent office, they were required to be appointed through the President and confirmed by the Senate. The Federal Circuit judges agreed with Arthrex's position, vacated the PTAB's ruling, ruled that the APJs' tenure must be changed to reflex this stance, and remanded the case back to the PTAB for a rehearing.
 Supreme Court 
Arthrex, Smith & Nephew, and the government all petitioned to the Supreme Court for review of the Federal Circuit's decision. While Smith & Nephew and the government sought to challenge the general finding of the Federal Circuit, Arthrex was not satisfied that the Circuit's remedy related to the changes in tenure resolved the constitutionality problem, believing this was a matter that Congress was required to solve. The Court granted certiorari in October 2020. Oral arguments were held on March 1, 2021.
The Court's decision was issued on June 21, 2021. The Supreme Court, by a 5–4 vote, vacated the Federal Circuit's ruling and remanded the case for review. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, found the APJs were principal officers with "unreviewable authority" under the Appointments Clause, and thus their appointment outside of the President and Senate was unconstitutional. Roberts wrote "The unreviewable executive power exercised [...] is incompatible with their status as inferior officers. Only an officer properly appointed to a principal office may issue a final decision binding the executive branch in the proceeding before us."
Turning to the matter of a remedy, the Court ruled in a 7–2 decision that the matter can be resolved by having all PTAB judicial decisions be subject to review by the Director of the patent office, who is appointed through the normal Appointments Clause process. Alito, Kavanaugh and Barrett joined Roberts in the plurality opinion on this matter. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote an opinion dissenting on the issue of APJs under the Appointments Clause, but concurring on the remedy judgement, joined by Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. The Court further ruled that prior PTAB decisions were not overruled but did allow such cases to be subject to the same review by the patent office director.
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion to both decisions to which Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined in regards to the decision related to the Appointments Clause. Thomas believed the APJs should have been classified as inferior officers and thus not subject to the Appointments Clause. Thomas wrote "The court today draws a new line dividing inferior officers from principal ones. The fact that this line places administrative patent judges on the side of ambassadors, Supreme Court justices and department heads suggests that something is not quite right." In his dissent-in-part, Breyer wrote "Today’s decision is both unprecedented and unnecessary, and risks pushing the judiciary further into areas where we lack both the authority to act and the capacity to act wisely."
Justice Gorsuch wrote separately to dissent on the remedy, stating he would have turned to Congress to determine how to resolve the matter through their preferred system.

From "United States v. Arvizu" ==> """
United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266 (2002), is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously reaffirmed the proposition that the Fourth Amendment required courts to analyze the reasonableness of a traffic stop based on the totality of the circumstances instead of examining the plausibility of each reason an officer gives for stopping a motorist individually.
Facts of the Case
U.S. Border Patrol agent Clinton Stoddard was working a checkpoint on U.S. Highway 191 north of Douglas, Arizona on an afternoon in January 1998.  In this area, the roads are equipped with sensors to alert agents to the presence of traffic on infrequently traveled roads, a sign that smugglers of drugs or aliens might be in the area.  At 2:15 p.m., a car passing on a nearby road tripped a sensor, and Stoddard went to investigate.  Agents typically changed shifts around this time.
Stoddard found the vehicle that tripped the sensor.  It was a minivan, the sort of car that smugglers use to transport their cargo.  As it approached Stoddard, it slowed dramatically, from about 55 miles per hour to about 30.  An adult man was driving.  His posture was rigid, and he conspicuously ignored Stoddard as Stoddard passed by.  Stoddard found this behavior suspicious because most drivers in the area wave at passing motorists.  Stoddard also noticed children sitting in the back seat of the minivan.  Their knees were propped up high, as if their feet were resting on something on the floor.  At this point, Stoddard pulled alongside the car.  The children in the back seat started to wave at Stoddard in a peculiar manner.  As Stoddard was driving alongside the car, the driver abruptly signaled a turn onto the last available road that would avoid the checkpoint.  Stoddard radioed for a registration check on the minivan, and found out that it was registered to an address in Douglas known for heavy narcotics trafficking.  At this point Stoddard stopped the minivan.  Stoddard learned that the driver's name was Ralph Arvizu.  Stoddard asked Arvizu for permission to search the van, and found almost 129 pounds of marijuana.
Arvizu was charged in district court with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.  In federal court, he asked to suppress the marijuana, arguing that Stoddard did not have reasonable suspicion to stop him.  Citing these facts and the circuitous nature of the route Arvizu was taking from Douglas to nearby Tucson, the district court denied Arvizu's suppression motion.  
Arvizu appealed to the Ninth Circuit.  After analyzing each of the 10 factors relied on by the district court in isolation, the Ninth Circuit concluded that seven of the 10 factors were susceptible of an innocent explanation and thus carried little or no weight in the reasonable-suspicion analysis.  The remaining factors—the fact that the route was frequently traveled by smugglers, the timing of the alert relative to the agents' shift change, and the fact that Arvizu was driving a minivan—did not render the stop permissible.  Consequently, the court reversed Arvizu's conviction.  The government appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Court's Ruling
The Court reiterated that when reviewing courts make reasonable suspicion determinations, they must look at the totality of the circumstances to see if the officer had a particularized and objective basis for suspecting a person of committing a crime.  According to the Court, the approach taken by the Ninth Circuit, in which it found that seven of Stoddard's ten reasons were susceptible of an innocent explanation, did not examine the totality of the circumstances and thus ran counter to the de novo review that the Court had previously ruled should apply to appellate review of reasonable suspicion determinations.  For Arvizu to slow down, stiffen his posture, and avoid making eye contact was suspicious in an area like southeastern Arizona where most drivers are courteous and polite to other drivers.  Furthermore, the children had obviously been coached to wave at Stoddard as he was driving by.  Taken together, these factors suggest that Stoddard reasonably suspected Arvizu was engaged in criminal activity.
Scalia's Concurring Remarks
Scalia agreed that the Court was correct to reemphasize that the de novo standard of review applies to appellate review of rulings regarding reasonable suspicion.  Even so, he criticized the Court's deference to a district judge's "factual inferences," finding it to be incompatible with de novo review.

From "United States v. Bagley" ==> """
United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667 (1985), was a Supreme Court of the United States case that established the standard for materiality under Brady v. Maryland.
 Background 
 Brady and its progeny 
In Brady v. Maryland (1963), the Supreme Court held that the prosecution must disclose all exculpatory evidence to the defense. The only requirements being that the evidence is favorable to the defendant and material.Criminal Law: Cases and Materials, 7th ed., 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder,  Thirteen years later, the Supreme Court defined what it meant for evidence to be material in a case called United States v. Agurs (1976). In Agurs, the Court set two different standards of materiality based on whether or not the defendant requested the nondisclosed evidence.
 Facts of the case 
After being indicted on 15 charges of violating federal narcotic and firearm statutes, Hughes Bagley's counsel filed a discovery motion that requested information on the witnesses the prosecution intended to call, their criminal records, and any promises made to them in exchange for testimony.United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 669-70 (1985). At Bagley's bench trial, two state law-enforcement officers testified as the prosecution's principal witnesses. The prosecution did not notify the defendant of any promises made to them in exchange for testimony, as required. Mr. Bagley was subsequently found guilty of all the narcotics charges but not guilty for all of the firearms charges.Bagley, 473 U.S. at 671-72.
In 1980, while incarcerated for the narcotic charges, Bagley filed a Freedom of Information Act request and received response copies of ATF contracts that the principal witnesses had signed three years prior. These forms were entitled "Contract for Purchase of Information and Payment of Lump Sum Therefor" and indicated $300 was to be paid to the witnesses. Each form stated that the principal witnesses would:
Bagley moved to vacate his sentence under Brady v. Maryland, arguing that his right to due process had been violated by the prosecution's failure to disclose these forms. The district court ruled against Bagley but was reversed by the Ninth Circuit.
 Opinion of the court 
 Part I 
In the first part of the Justice Harry Blackmun's opinion for the court, the factual and procedural history was laid out; Part I ended with the Court's ruling to reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.Bagley, 473 U.S. at 669-74.
The District Court, in denying to vacate Bagley's sentence, had found that had the existence of the agreements been disclosed during trial, the disclosure would have had no effect upon its finding that the Government had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent was guilty of the offenses for which he had been convicted.Bagley, 473 U.S. at 673. The District Court had reasoned that the witness testimony largely focused to the firearms charges, which Bagley had been acquitted on, and only briefly concerned the narcotics charge. The District Court had also said that on cross-examination, Bagley's attorney had not sought to discredit their testimony as to the facts of distribution but rather sought to show that the controlled substances in question came from supplies that had been prescribed for Bagley's personal use and that the witnesses' answers there tended to be favorable. Thus, the claimed impeachment evidence would not have been helpful and would not have affected the outcome of the trial.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court's decision in Bagley v. Lumpkin, 719 F.2d 1462 (1983). The Court of Appeals began by noting that, according to precedent, prosecutorial failure to respond to a specific Brady request is properly analyzed as error, and a resulting conviction must be reversed unless the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court then noted that the District Judge who had presided over the bench trial concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that disclosure of the ATF agreement would not have affected the outcome.Bagley, 473 U.S. at 673-74. The Court of Appeals, however, stated that it disagreed with this conclusion, in particular, with the Government's premise that the testimony was exculpatory on the narcotics charges, and that Bagley therefore would not have sought to impeach "his own witness."
The Blackmun opinion characterized the Court of Appeals reversal as having been based on the theory that the Government's failure to disclose the requested Brady information that respondent could have used to conduct an effective cross-examination impaired respondent's right to confront adverse witnesses, as the Court of Appeals opinion had concluded by saying: 
 Part II 
The majority opinion continued by discussing that the basis for Brady was the requirement of due process.Bagley, 473 U.S. at 675. The Court reiterated that the due process requirement was not to displace the adversarial system, but to ensure that there was no miscarriage of justice. Prosecutors only had to disclose evidence favorable to the accused that, if suppressed, would deprive the defendant of a fair trial. This information under Brady and its progeny had to be material and exculpatory, which would include impeachment evidence.Bagley, 473 U.S. at 676.
The Court held that the constitutional error, if any, was in the Government's failure to assist the defense by disclosing information that might have been helpful in conducting the cross-examination, and that suppression of evidence amounts to a constitutional violation only if it deprives the defendant of a fair trial.Bagley, 473 U.S. at 678. It held that this only occurs if the evidence is material in the sense that its suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.
 Part III 
Only Justices Harry Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor signed onto Part III of the majority opinion where they adopted the Strickland v. Washington standard for prejudicial deficient performance by counsel as the new standard for materiality under Brady. Under that standard, nondisclosed evidence is material if it has a "reasonable probability" to alter the trial result. By doing so, the opinion framed the standard as flexible enough to cover previous scenarios where the defendant requested or did not request the evidence in question. The opinion further defined "reasonable probability" as "a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome."Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682.
The Blackmun opinion permitted trial courts to make an additional inquiry in specific request cases (i.e., when the defendant asked for the nondisclosed evidence specifically), to determine whether the defendant's case was adversely affected by the withholding.Emily D. Quinn, Standards of Materiality Governing the Prosecutorial Duty to Disclose Evidence to the Defense, 6 Alaska L. Rev. 147, 158 (1989)
Justice Blackmun finished the opinion by reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remanding the case to that court for a determination whether there is a reasonable probability the trial's result would have been different, had the inducement offered by the Government been disclosed.Bagley, 473 U.S. at 684.
 White concurrence  
Justice Byron White wrote a concurrence that was joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice William Rehnquist. The three signed onto the new "reasonable probability" standard discussed in Part III but did not join the Blackmun opinion's statements regarding specific requests.
 Marshall dissent 
Justice Thurgood Marshall's dissent, joined by Justice William J. Brennan Jr., stated  Bagley, 473 U.S. at 685.
Marshall further wrote that the majority opinion's characterization of the witness testimony was inaccurate; that Bagley's attorney had tried to impeach O'Connor, by asking him whether two ATF agents had pressured him or had threatened that his job might be in jeopardy, in order to get him to cooperate, but that O'Connor had answered in the negative, so he stopped this line of questioning.Bagley, 473 U.S. at 689-90. Bagley's attorney even had attempted to argue to the District Court, in his closing argument, that the witnesses, O'Connor and Mitchell, had "fabricated" their accounts, but the court rejected the proposition.Bagley, 473 U.S. at 690.
Marshall's dissent stated "Whatever the applicable standard of materiality . . . in this instance it undoubtedly is well met."Bagley, 473 U.S. at 691. The dissent continued to say that the prosecutor's duty is straightforward, that they must divulge all evidence that reasonably appears favorable to the defendant, erring on the side of disclosure, but that the Court offered a complex alternative, defining the right not by reference to the possible usefulness of the particular evidence in preparing and presenting the case, but retrospectively, by reference to the likely effect the evidence will have on the outcome of the trial.Bagley, 473 U.S. at 699. Marshall believed the standard would allow prosecutors to avoid disclosing obviously exculpatory evidence.Bagley, 473 U.S. at 701.
 Stevens dissent 
Justice Stevens wrote a dissent to say that he agreed the Court of Appeals misdescribed the rule stated in Brady, but disagreed with the Court's unwarranted decision to rewrite the rule itself.Bagley, 473 U.S. at 709.
 Scholarly criticisms 
Bagley has been criticized by scholars for requiring prosecutors to make disclosure decisions based upon their post-hoc view of how the trial will go.Gerard Fowke, Material to Whom?: Implementing Brady's Duty to Disclose at Trial and During Plea Bargaining, 50 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 575, 595 (2013).Jordan Chemtob, Foul Blows: Using the Ethical Standard to Prevent Low-Level Brady Violations from Slipping Through the Cracks, 34 Geo. J. Leg. Ethics 807, 815 (2021). Gerald Fowke stated that "[t]he chasm between 'a reasonable probability' and 'sufficien[cy] to undermine confidence in the outcome' cannot be bridged by defining the former with the latter" because probabilities are objective, and confidence is subjective.

From "United States v. Bajakajian" ==> """
United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321 (1998), is a U.S. Supreme Court case holding that asset forfeiture is unconstitutional when it is "grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant’s offense", citing the Excessive Fines clause of the Eighth Amendment..  It was the first time the Court struck down the federal government's "aggressive use of forfeiture" and the only time it has held that an imposed fine was unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment.
 Background 
In 1993, Syrian immigrant Hosep Bajakajian and his family tried to fly from Los Angeles to Cyprus via Italy with $357,144 in their luggage in order to pay a debt. The federal government sought forfeiture of the entire sum under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which requires all international currency transfers exceeding $10,000 in value to be reported on a Currency and Other Monetary Instruments Report (CMIR); the BSA also allows forfeiture of "any property, real or personal" in cases of violations. None of the money was found to have been connected with any other criminal action whatsoever. He was also initially charged with lying to customs, which was later dropped.
Bajakajian pleaded guilty to failure to report and opted for a bench trial on the forfeiture of the $357,144. A United States district court judge found the forfeiture of the whole $357,144 to be grossly disproportionate and in violation of the Eighth Amendment. He ordered forfeiture of $15,000 in addition to the maximum fine of $5,000 and three years probation for failure to report. Bajakajian had been eligible for six months in prison, but the judge did not impose this sentence.
In 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision and stated its willingness to go further by ruling that the forfeiture of any of the currency was unconstitutional. Unfortunately for Bajakajian, he had not appealed the forfeiture to the Ninth Circuit and they were thus unable to set it aside.
 Opinion of the Court 
The case was argued before the Supreme Court on November 4, 1997, and decided on June 22, 1998. The Opinion of the Court was delivered by Justice Clarence Thomas, who was joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O'Connor and Justice Scalia.
At issue was the Bank Secrecy Act, which provided that violators face forfeiture of "any property, real or personal".. As understood by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, this law allowed the forfeiture of all of the money that the respondent had tried to take out of the country. The question was whether this conflicted with the Eighth Amendment's provision that "excessive fines [not be] imposed".
Justice Thomas concluded:
Comparing the gravity of respondent's crime with the $357,144 forfeiture the Government seeks, we conclude that such a forfeiture would be grossly disproportional to the gravity of his offense. It is larger than the $5,000 fine imposed by the District Court by many orders of magnitude, and it bears no articulable correlation to any injury suffered by the Government.Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 339-40.
Although Thomas noted that the case was complicated by the fact that both federal law and the government's case in Bajakajian somewhat blurred the distinction between civil forfeiture and a fine intended to punish, it was clear in this case that punishment was at least part of the government's intent. Clarifying whether seizures of property are considered fines or punishments, he decreed that a criminal forfeiture could be considered as both a type of fine and a punishment, while a civil forfeiture was not intended as a punishment of a person but rather a "legal fiction of punishing the property", concluding that civil forfeitures were not a type of fine. However, the case allowed the Court to look at the issue of excessive fines apart from other criminal issues because there were no charges against the respondent other than failing to report the cash transfer; a separate charge of lying to customs officials had been dropped. 
Impact
As of 2015, there have been 150 federal circuit court decisions that relied on Bajakajian to conduct an excessiveness test, but only 4 of them have found excessive forfeiture. One commentator argues that this is due to lower courts applying the Bajakajian framework too rigidly.
Bajakajian'''s application is being extended beyond forfeiture. In Duckworth v. United States (2011), the D.C. Circuit applied Bajakajian to the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, upholding fines imposed by NOAA. In United States v. Lessner (2007), the Third Circuit applied it to the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, which established procedures to determine restitution for victims, and upheld a $938,965.59 restitution order. In United States v. Stebbins'' (2005), the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces upheld a $75,000 fine to punish a soldier found guilty of raping a minor.

The case arose from the appeal of the conviction of two leaders of the new religious "I AM" Activity movement for fraudulently seeking and collecting donations on the basis of religious claims that the defendants themselves did not believe. .  
The Supreme Court held that the question of whether the defendants' claims about their religious experiences were actually true should not have been submitted to a jury.  The Court arrived at this conclusion in part because the "freedom of religious belief... embraces the right to maintain theories of life and of death and of the hereafter which are rank heresy to followers of the orthodox faiths." However, the Court did not address the issue of whether the sincerity of the defendants' beliefs was a proper question for the jury.
Justice Robert H. Jackson, dissenting, would have gone even farther, suggesting that the entire case should be dismissed for coming too close to being an investigation into the truth of a religious conviction. He would have held unconstitutional a jury determination of whether the defendants' religious beliefs were sincere, as well as whether they were true.
 Prior history 
After Guy Ballard's death, his wife, Edna Anne Wheeler Ballard, and son, Donald Ballard, were indicted for 18 counts of fraud.  The indictment charged that the Ballards fraudulently collected over $3 million from their followers on the basis of religious claims the Ballards knew were false.  Their followers protested outside the courthouse.
The District Court instructed the jury to convict if they found that the Ballards did not have a good faith belief in their religious claims.  The Ballards were convicted.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the conviction and granted a new trial, declaring that the District Court erred in restricting the issue to whether the defendants had a good faith belief in their claims. The government appealed to the Supreme Court.
 Decision 
 Majority opinion 
Written by: William O. Douglas; joined by: Black, Reed, Murphy, Rutledge
The majority opinion reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals and remanded the case to that court, ruling that the question of the truth or falsity of the beliefs had been rightly withheld from the jury.  There was no ruling on the propriety of the jury instructions regarding the sincerity of the defendants' beliefs. In his majority opinion, Justice Douglas wrote:
The religious views espoused by respondents might seem incredible, if not preposterous, to most people. But if those doctrines are subject to trial before a jury charged with finding their truth or falsity, then the same can be done with the religious beliefs of any sect. When the triers of fact undertake that task, they enter a forbidden domain. The First Amendment does not select any one group or any one type of religion for preferred treatment. It puts them all in that position.
 Chief Justice Stone's dissent 
Written by: Stone; joined by: Roberts, Frankfurter
Chief Justice Stone, dissenting, argued that the question of truthfulness was appropriate for the jury:United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78 (1944)
I am not prepared to say that the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion affords immunity from criminal prosecution for the fraudulent procurement of money by false statements as to one's religious experiences, more than it renders polygamy or libel immune from criminal prosecution... I cannot say that freedom of thought and worship includes freedom to procure money by making knowingly false statements about one's religious experiences.
 Justice Jackson's dissent 
Justice Jackson dissented because he believed that the First Amendment foreclosed inquiry into both the truthfulness of the defendants' religious claims and their sincerity. He would have dismissed the case entirely for being too close to a religious persecution:
I should say the defendants have done just that for which they are indicted. If I might agree to their conviction without creating a precedent, I cheerfully would do so. I can see in their teachings nothing but humbug, untainted by any trace of truth. But that does not dispose of the constitutional question whether misrepresentation of religious experience or belief is prosecutable; it rather emphasizes the danger of such prosecutions.
Prosecutions of this character easily could degenerate into religious persecution.
I would dismiss the indictment and have done with this business of judicially examining other people's faiths.
All schools of religious thought make enormous assumptions, generally on the basis of revelations authenticated by some sign or miracle.
Some who profess belief in the Bible read literally what others read as allegory or metaphor, as they read Aesop's fables.
If we try religious sincerity severed from religious verity, we isolate the dispute from the very considerations which, in common experience, provide its most reliable answer.
William James, who wrote on these matters as a scientist, reminds us that it is not theology and ceremonies which keep religion going. Its vitality is in the religious experiences of many people.  "If you ask what these experiences are, they are conversations with the unseen, voices and visions, responses to prayer, changes of heart, deliverances from fear, inflowings of help, assurances of support, whenever certain persons set their own internal attitude in certain appropriate ways."
If religious liberty includes, as it must, the right to communicate such experiences to others, it seems to me an impossible task for juries to separate fancied ones from real ones, dreams from happenings, and hallucinations from true clairvoyance. Such experiences, like some tones and colors, have existence for one, but none at all for another. They cannot be verified to the minds of those whose field of consciousness does not include religious insight. When one comes to trial which turns on any aspect of religious belief or representation, unbelievers among his judges are likely not to understand, and are almost certain not to believe, him.
 Subsequent history 
On remand to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit the original conviction was affirmed without rehearing by the Court of Appeals. The defendants once again petitioned for a writ of certiorari and it was once again granted, this time on the issue of women being excluded from grand jury and the trial jury. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the defendants and dismissed the indictment as well as the subsequent conviction.Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187 (1946)

From "United States v. Ballin" ==> """
United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1 (1892), is a decision issued on February 29, 1892 by the United States Supreme Court, discussing the constitutional definition of "a quorum to do business" in Congress.United States v. Ballin,  Justice David Brewer delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court, analyzing the constitutional limitations on the United States Senate and House of Representatives when determining their rules of proceedings. In particular, the Court held that it fell within the powers of the House and Senate to establish their own rules for verifying whether a majority of their members is present, as required for a quorum under Article I of the Constitution.
The case was brought after the Board of General Appraisers affirmed the decision of the Collector of New York to classify imported worsted cloth as woolens, thus subjecting them to a higher rate of customs duty.  The importers challenged the validity of the law authorizing the duty increase, alleging that a quorum was not present when the law was passed.  On appeal, the Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York sustained the importers' claim and reversed the Board's decision. The United States appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed the Circuit Court's judgment and upheld the Board's decision. The decision established unambiguously that when a quorum is present, approval by a majority of that quorum is sufficient for the House or Senate to pass a bill.
Background
In its first 100 years, the United States House of Representatives did not pass legislation unless a full quorum of the House approved the bill. Those present, but not voting, could block votes and prevent a quorum—the technique of the disappearing quorum. The practice was terminated in February 1890, with the adoption of a new set of House rules. In particular, Rule XV (passed on February 14, 1890House Journal, 230, February 14, 1890, cited in ) established that a quorum is satisfied if a majority of members are present, even if they withhold their votes on a particular bill.
On March 1, 1888, the Ways and Means Committee of the House had started review of the McKinley Tariff bill, which would eventually pass the House on May 21, 1890. One part of the bill, drafted by Nelson Dingley, Jr. and known as the Worsted act, would "authorize and direct the Secretary of the Treasury to classify as woolen cloths all imports of worsted cloth,", c.200 in order to levy a higher rate of customs duty.  The Worsted act came up for vote on May 9, 1890, garnering 138 yeas and 3 nays. House Speaker Thomas B. Reed requested a roll call, and 74 representatives were recorded by the clerk in the House Journal as being present and refusing to vote.  The speaker concluded that those voting, together with the 74 members withholding their votes (in total more than 166 representatives), constituted a quorum present to do business.  The House at the time comprised 330 seats. While the 51st Congress would eventually reach 332 seats, the Worsted act was voted on prior to Idaho and Wyoming being admitted to the Union.  Since 138 yeas were more than one-half of the members present and voting (141 total voting, 215 total present), the speaker declared that the Worsted act had been passed.
On July 21, 1890, Ballin, Joseph & Co imported into New York certain manufactures of worsted.In re Ballin et al., , (rev'g the Decision of the Board of United States General Appraisers), rev'd, . In line with the Worsted act, the collector assessed the duty rate prescribed at the time for manufactures of wool. The importers contended that the duty collected was in excess of what the law permitted, according to schedule K of , c.121.  In their request for refund from the Board of General Appraisers, the importers argued that the Worsted act had been enacted in violation of Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution of the United States.  In particular, Ballin argued that a quorum of the House had not been present when the vote was taken and therefore the bill had not been legally passed.
On October 13, 1890, the Board ruled against Ballin.  Judge Henderson M. Somerville drafted the Board's decision, finding that the act of May 9, 1890, had been constitutionally enacted and that the duty had been correctly assessed by the New York collector.  The importers appealed to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, which reversed the Board's decision.  The circuit court reasoned that the act Congress had passed "expressly confined the exercise of its powers to the Secretary of the Treasury, in exclusion of any other officer" and that the collector had overstepped his bounds.
Opinion of the Court
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on December 2, 1891, with Attorney General William Miller and Solicitor General William Howard Taft arguing the case for the government.  Edwin B. Smith represented Ballin, Joseph & Co.  Two questions were presented to the Court: "Was the act of May 9, 1890, legally passed?", and "What was the act's meaning?"  On February 29, 1892, the Court issued its unanimous decision, addressing both questions in turn.
The Court started by assuming that information recorded in the House Journal is always accurate. This effectively dismissed any claims based on possible mistakes in the journal.  The Court noted that Speaker Reed's actions on May 9, 1890, as recorded in the journal, were in direct compliance with Rule XV;  Rule XV had been legally enacted under the Rules of Proceedings Clause of the Constitution.. "The Constitution empowers each house to determine its rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or method of proceeding established by the rule and the result which is sought to be attained. [...] The power to make rules is not one which once exercised is exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be exercised by the house, and within the limitations suggested, absolute and beyond the challenge of any other body or tribunal."  Article I, Section 5, Clause 1, of the Constitution provides that "a majority of each [house] shall constitute a quorum to do business."  Rule XV provided the House with a clear method to establish the presence of a quorum.
After determining that a quorum of the House had been present on May 9, 1890, the Court addressed the legality of enacting the Worsted act. The universal default rule of parliamentary bodies is that a majority of the quorum may take action.  "The general rule of all parliamentary bodies is that, when a quorum is present, the act of a majority of the quorum is the act of the body [...], except so far as [...] the terms of the organic act under which the body is assembled have prescribed specific limitations. [...] No such limitation is found in the Federal Constitution, and therefore the general law of such bodies obtains." and therefore the power of the house "[arises] when a majority are present."    In concluding their analysis of the first question, the Court stated that "a majority shall be a quorum to do business; but a majority of that quorum is sufficient to decide the most important question.", quoting 
Having established that the Worsted act was legally passed, the Court addressed the second question. The act unambiguously stated that duties on worsted cloths became identical to those placed on woolen cloths by the Tariff Act of 1883. Although no direct action was necessary by the Secretary of the Treasury to put this act into force, the Treasury Department issued a letter on May 13, 1890, instructing all customs officers to publish the act "for the information and guidance of the public."
The judgment of the Circuit Court was reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.
Reaction
The decision of the Supreme Court came as no surprise in Washington.  Even Democrats who had objected to Reed's tactics in the Republican-controlled House as tyrannical, readily admitted that Representatives should participate in the business of the House whenever present.  After being congratulated by his colleagues, Reed remarked on how pleased he was by the Court's decision: "That the whole need not participate is settled, their presence being the only essential."
The Spokane Review did not see the news as good, however, proclaiming that czarism had taken over the government:  "The supreme court has handed down an infamous decision sustaining the ruling of Speaker Reed that a quorum is a quorum whether some of the members are dumb, deaf, blind or devoid of common sense. It is evident that we [...] will never enjoy perfect happiness until [this country] fills every branch of the public service with filibusterers and equips them with supreme power to block the transaction of business."
Subsequent developments
In their 1995 Open Letter to Congressman Gingrich Bruce Ackerman and 16 other well-known law professors asserted that rules of procedure in Congress that require more than a simple majority of those voting to pass legislation are unconstitutional, in part basing their conclusion on the decision of Ballin.  In particular, Ackerman et al. were writing about a rule adopted by the 104th Congress requiring a three-fifths majority to  pass an increase in income tax rates.  Professors John O. McGinnis and Michael B. Rappaport responded in the article The Constitutionality of Legislative Supermajority Requirements: A Defense by interpreting Ballin as stating that the universal default rule that a majority of the quorum may take action applies only when neither the Constitution nor the legislature imposes a specific rule.
On that topic, the U.S. Mason's Manual notes, "A deliberative body cannot by its own act or rule require a two-thirds vote to take any action where the constitution or controlling authority requires only a majority vote. To require a two-thirds vote, for example, to take any action would be to give to any number more than one-third of the members the power to defeat the action and amount to a delegation of the powers of the body to a minority." The Rules of Proceedings Clause in the Constitution—the organic act under which Congress is assembled—authorizes the houses of Congress to pass a supermajority rule if they so choose. Hence, rules requiring supermajorities are constitutional, but the rules themselves could be changed by a simple majority.
The debate between minority rights and majority rule continues , in particular as it relates to filibustering in the United States Senate.  If the Senate voted on whether to change the cloture rule, only a simple majority would be needed to change it, though the attempt itself might be filibustered in an effort to prevent the majority from reaching a vote.  However, the Senate reinterpreted the rule to require only a simple majority for cloture for nominations (or, more precisely, for confirmation of Presidential nominations) using the nuclear option in 2013 and 2017 and doing so for legislation has been suggested by both President Trump and some senators.

From "United States v. Barker" ==> """
United States v. Barker, 15 U.S. (2 Wheat.) 395 (1817), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court upholding the common law tradition that private citizens may not demand costs from the federal government.. The case involved a motion for costs filed against the United States Government and resolved the previously unanswered question of whether courts could award costs against the United States federal government.Henry v. United States, 15 Ct. Cl. 162, 167 (1879) (describing United States v. Barker as a case involving a "motion for costs"); Dist. of Columbia v. Lyon, 7 Mackey 222, 224 (D.C. June 3, 1889) (noting that the Court in Barker "finally disposed of the question forever"). The Court's opinion read, in its entirety, "The United States never pays costs." Jurists have remarked that Chief Justice John Marshall's six-word opinion is one of the shortest Supreme Court cases ever written.United States v. Jardine, 81 F.2d 747, 748 (5th Cir. 1936). 
Background
In English common law, parties to litigation could never receive costs unless costs were specifically provided for by statute.Dist. of Columbia v. Lyon, 7 Mackey 222, 223 (D.C. June 3, 1889). The first law to provide plaintiffs the possibility of recovering costs was the Statute of Gloucester (6 Edward I), which allowed for costs in a limited range of cases. The first statute providing costs for defendants was 23 Henry VIII, and costs for penal actions were made available by the statute of 4 James I. However, "because of its position as sovereign suing in its own courts," costs were never available against the government. William Blackstone noted in his Commentaries on the Laws of England that the King would never pay or receive costs at trial.3 Blackstone, , 400. 
In the 1796 case United States v. La Vengeance, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of a citizen who claimed the government had unlawfully seized his ship, and the Court affirmed his judgment "with costs" charged against the federal government.United States v. La Vengeance, 3 U.S. 297, 3 Dall. 297 (1796). However, the day after the Court issued its ruling in La Vengeance, Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth ordered the words "with costs" be struck from the opinion.. According to Chief Justice John Marshall, Ellsworth "observed, in doing this, the court did not mean to be understood as at all deciding the question, whether, in any case, they could award costs against the United States, but left it entirely open for future discussion." Although this question remained unsettled for twenty years after La Vengeance, the Court's opinion in United States v. Barker "finally disposed of the question forever."Dist. of Columbia v. Lyon, 7 Mackey 222, 224 (D.C. June 3, 1889).
Opinion of the Court
Writing for a unanimous majority of the Court, Chief Justice John Marshall delivered what has been described as "[o]ne of the shortest opinions in the books," in which the opinion stated, in its entirety:Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Johnson Shipyards Corp., 6 F.2d 752, 757 (2d Cir. 1925) ("Chief Justice Marshall rendered the decision of the Supreme Court, the  whole of which follows: ‘The United States never pay costs.'"). "The United States never pays costs."

From "United States v. Behrman" ==> """
United States v. Behrman, 258 U.S. 280 (1922), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a violation of the Harrison Narcotics Act did not require a mens rea element and was thus a strict liability crime.Bonnie, R.J. et al.  Criminal Law, Second Edition.  Foundation Press, New York: 2004, p. 262
 Background 
The defendant was a licensed physician that wrote prescriptions to Willie King for 150 grains of heroin, 360 grains of morphine, and 210 grains of cocaine as part of a maintenance treatment.  The defendant was indicted under the Harrison Act, but the district court dismissed the indictment.Bonnie, p. 261
Decision
The Supreme Court held that the facts were sufficient to support an indictment.  The court held that the violation of the Harrison Act was a statutory offense, and because Congress had not written in a mental state element as part of the offense that the Court should not do so.Bonnie, p. 263
Dissent
Justice Holmes, joined by Justices Brandeis and McReynolds, dissented, saying that if the doctor had given the prescriptions in good faith and with reasonable care that he should have a defense.Bonnie, p. 262

From "United States v. Belmont" ==> """
United States v. Belmont, 301 U.S. 324 (1937), was a dispute between the federal executive branch and the State of New York over property rights to a deposit from a former Russian corporation with August Belmont & Company, a private New York City banking firm..  Belmont established executive predominance over state laws and constitutions in the sphere of foreign policy, and allocated the constitutional power for initiating executive agreements solely to the president of the United States.Belmont, 301 U.S. at 330–32.
 Background 
During the Russian Revolution, Petrograd Metal Works, a Russian corporation, deposited a sum of money with August Belmont & Company, a private banker in New York City.  On November 6, 1917, the Bolsheviks took control of Russia. With the establishment of the Communist regime, they issued several decrees, which inter alia (among other things) ratified confiscation of private properties without compensation.Nebolsine, "The Recovery of the Foreign Assets," 1130.  The Decree of June 15, 1918 was enacted exclusively to outline nationalization of manufacturing companies; a portion of it reads as follows:
In an effort to preserve their estates, fugitive business owners had relocated their assets to foreign banks. This impeded Soviet attempts to retrieve those deposits, mainly because they had to negotiate with foreign tribunals which consistently inclined toward the former owners.Nebolsine, "The Recovery of the Foreign Assets," 1132.
The United States' non-recognition of the Communist state precluded the Soviet government from filing disputes in U.S. courts.Nebolsine, "The Recovery of the Foreign Assets," 1133.  Likewise, as a result of Soviet nationalization, the U.S. could not seek any legal remedies from the Soviet nation.  In an attempt to recover the losses due to Russian communalization, President Franklin D. Roosevelt began negotiations with the Communist state.Millett, "The Constitutionality of Executive Agreements," 1.  On November 16, 1933, the President held his first annual dinner party, with Soviet Commissar of Foreign Affairs, Maxim Litvinov, as his guest.  During this event, he presented Litvinov prepared drafts with conditions under which the U.S. was willing to recognize Soviet Russia.Millett, "The Constitutionality of Executive Agreements," 2.  The same day, both officials signed their exchanged notes, later known as the Roosevelt–Litvinov Accords.  Along with a section acknowledging the Communist state, this document permitted the U.S. government to collect all amounts "due or that may be found to be due" deposited in the U.S. banks by former owners of Russian corporations, provided that the Soviet government was "to be duly notified in each case of any amount realized by the Government of the United States from such release and assignment."Belmont, 301 U.S. at 326.  Within the nine years of litigations, the United States Department of Justice successfully recovered nearly ten million dollars in Soviet funds.Millett, "The Constitutionality of Executive Agreements," 4.  One of its victories was the case of United States v. Belmont, in which the Supreme Court allowed the U.S. Government to recover Petrograd's deposits, holding that the presidential agreement with Russia superseded the laws of the State of New York; petitioner's complaint to recover deposited sum constituted a cause of action against the respondents, duly-appointed executors of Belmont's will.Belmont, 301 U.S. at 333.
 Procedural history 
The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the case, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's decision, holding that the case in question should be decided according to New York State laws, not federal, for: (1) the deposit was placed in the state of New York; (2) titles are a matters of state laws; and (3) pursuant to the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the New York Civil Practice Act § 977-b, petitioner's claim could not have been recognized at least "until after the expiration of the period within which creditors or stockholders may claim it."
 Holding 
On May 3, 1937, the United States Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Circuit Court's decision in holding: (1) The president has the power to initiate executive agreements with foreign states without the advice or consent of the Senate; (2) The executive agreements are binding over state constitutions, laws, and policies; and (3) The United States Constitution is not extraterritorial, except in respect to U.S. citizens.
 Opinion of the Supreme Court 
Delivered by Justice Sutherland:
"Governmental power over external affairs is vested exclusively in the national government;" state laws, constitutions, and policies are irrelevant in disputes concerning international agreements between two governments, and therefore, "no state can prevail against the international compact."Belmont, 301 U.S. at 327, 330, 332. Although under Article II §2 of the United States Constitution, treaties require the advice and consent of the Senate, "international compact, as this was, is not always a treaty," and it does not require participation of the Senate.Belmont, 301 U.S. at 330. The public policy of the United States, declared by the U.S. Constitution, prohibits confiscation of private property without just compensation. The U.S. Constitution, statutes, and policies, however,  "have no extraterritorial operation," except in respect to U.S. citizens.Belmont, 301 U.S. at 332. The actions of the Soviet government toward its citizens are not a matter for U.S. judicial review; such nationals shall seek remedy with their own nation's courts and government. The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution is not an issue here, for the respondents have no interests in that matter beyond that of a custodian. This decision, however, does not consider the status of adverse claims; it only holds that petitioner's complaint "alleges facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the respondents."
 Concurrence 
Delivered by Justice Stone, joined by Justice Brandeis and Justice Cardozo:
The concurrence agreed with the holding, but it did not follow the path by which this decision was reached.Belmont, 301 U.S. at 333 (Stone, J., concurring). While it supported the Court's decision allowing the U.S. Government to recover Petrograd's deposits, it disagreed with the majority's claim that the United States had greater rights than its transferor, and that the President, by mere executive action, had the right to alter the laws and policies of any state in which the debtor of an assigned claim might reside.Belmont, 301 U.S. at 336 (Stone, J., concurring).

From "United States v. Bestfoods" ==> """
United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51 (1998), is a United States corporate law and environmental law case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the indirect liability of a parent corporation under CERCLA is to be determined by its control over a subsidiary's facility, rather than the relationship between the corporation and subsidiary.
Facts
A chemical manufacturing plant developed a significant pollution problem after many years of operation. The companies in charge of operations at the plant were wholly owned subsidiaries of, first, CPC International Inc. (CPC). Following ownership by CPC, the chemical manufacturing plant was owned by Aerojet- General Corp (Aerojet). In 1981, the Environmental Protection Agency ordered to have the site cleaned up. To reimburse the cleanup, the federal government filed suit under Section 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. Section 9607(a)(2). Section 107 grants the federal government permission to seek reimbursement for cleanup costs from "any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility."
The question before the court, was whether a parent corporation that exercised control over the operations of a subsidiary be held liable under CERCLA Section 107(a)(2)?
Decision of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the unanimous decision in favor of the United States. The Court found the CERCLA statute definition of "owner or operator" as "any person owning or operating such facility" to be a circular definition in need of clarity. To determine whether Congress intended to include parent corporations when imposing liability on an owner or operator, the Court examined the legislative history of CERCLA, but due to the Act's hurried enactment, there was not much history to interpret. The Court concluded that Congress did not intend CERCLA to displace all of the established principles of corporate law, including the principle that a parent corporation is not usually liable for the acts of its subsidiary, but a corporate parent that actively participated in and exercised control over the operations of the facility  may be held directly liable in its own right as an 'operator' of the facility. The Court held that the corporate law principles read into the statute meant that liability will be attached under CERCLA for a parent corporation when the corporate veil can be pierced and when the parent actually participated in the operations of the facility where the release of hazardous substances was made.
